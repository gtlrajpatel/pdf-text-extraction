Finite Automata
A finite automaton, or finite state machine is a 5-tuple  where
 is finite set of states;
 is finite alphabet of input symbols;
 (initial state);
 (the set of accepting states);
 is a function from  (the transition function).
For any element  of  and any symbol , we interpret  as the state to which the FA moves, if it is in state  and receives the input .

To define accepting states, the states which contain the accepting states of NFA will be accepting states of final FA.

‹#›
Statement: Any regular language can be accepted by a finite automaton.
Proof:
On the basis of statement, can be recognized by FA, NFA and NFA-^. It is sufficient to so that every regular language can be accepted by NFA- ^.
Set of regular language over alphabet  contains the basic languages Ø, {^} and  to be closed under operation of union, concatenation, and Kleene*.
This allows us to prove using structural induction that every regular language over  can be accepted by an NFA-^.
The basis step of the proof is to show that the three basic languages can be accepted by NFA- ^s.
The induction hypothesis is that  and  are languages that can be accepted by NFA- ^s and the induction step is to show that  and  can also be.

Now, suppose that  and  are recognized by the NFA-^s  and , respectively, where for both =1 and =2,

By renaming states if necessary, we may assume that  ∩  = Ø. We will construct NFA-^s  , , and  recognizing the language  U , , and , respectively.

For either value of , if , then  can process 𝑥 by moving to  on a ^-transition and then executing the moves that cause  to accept 𝑥.
On the other hand, if 𝑥 is accepted by , there is a sequence of transition corresponding to 𝑥, starting at  and ending at an element of  or .
The first of these transitions must be a ^-transition from  to either or , since there are no other transition from .
Thereafter, since  ∩  = Ø, either all the transition are between of  or all are between elements of . It follow that 𝑥 must be accepted by either  or .

Finite automata with output
Finite automata has limited capability of either accepting a string or rejecting a string. Acceptance of string was based on the reachability of a machine from starting state to final state. 
Finite automata with output do not have a final state.
Machine generates output on every input.
There are two types of automata with outputs:
 Moore machine
 Mealy machine

Define pumping lemma and its application.
Suppose L is a regular language. Then there is an integer n so that for any x∈ L with |x|>=n, there are strings u, v, and w so that
x=uvw
|uv|<=n
|v|>0
For any m>=0,  ∈ L
Application
The pumping lemma is extremely useful in proving that certain sets are non-regular. The general methodology followed during its applications is 
Select a string z in the language L.
Break the string z into x, y and z in accordance with the above conditions imposed by the pumping lemma.
Now check if there is any contradiction to the pumping lemma for any value of i.

Use the pumping lemma to show that following language is not regular: L = {ww|w ϵ {0,1}*}
Step 1: 
Let us assume that L is regular and L is accepted by an FA with n states.
Step 2: 
Let us chose the string


Let us write w as xyz with 
|y| > 0
And |xy|<=n
Since |xy|<=n, x must be of the form .
Since |xy|<=n, y must be of the form  | r>0

Let us check whether x z for i=2 belongs to L.
	 =  = 
Since, r>0,  is not of the form   as the number of a’s in the first half is n+r and second half is n. 
Therefore,   Ɇ L. Hence by contradiction we can say language is not regular.
