The tape is capable of performing following three operations:
	Read a symbol above the tape head.
	Modify/Update a symbol above the tape head.
	Shifting either to previous square or next square.

Definition: Turing Machine
A Turing machine is a 5-tuple  where,
	is a finite set of states, assumed not to contain ha 	(Acceptance State) and hr (Rejection State).
	:  input Symbols
	 tape alphabets
	 : is initial state, is an element of Q.
	 : is a transition function.

The language 

is Turing Recognizable

Question : Given the description of a Turing Machine and some input string, can we decide the machine accepts it?
Answer: Just Run the TM on the input.
Possible results:
M accepts w: will halt and accept
M rejects w: will halt and reject
M loops on w: will not halt

Church Turing Thesis
What does computable mean?
Meaning of term Computable was given by:
Alonzo church (Lambda calculus)
Allen Turing (Turing Machine)

Any algorithmic procedure that can be carried out at all, by a human computer or a team of humans or an electronic computer, can be carried out by a TM. This statement usually referred to as Church’s thesis, or the Church-Turing thesis.

Church Turing Thesis
Here is an informal summary of some of the evidence.
Humans normally work with a two-dimensional sheet of paper. A TM tape could be organized so as to simulate two dimensions; one likely consequence would be that the TM would require more moves to do what a human could do in one.
Various enhancements of the TM model have been suggested to make the operation more like that of a human computer, or more convenient & efficient. The multitape TM is an example.
Other theoretical models includes abstract machines with two stacks or  with a queue.
Since the introduction of the Turing machine, no one has suggested any type of computation that ought to be included in the category of “algorithmic procedure” and cannot be implemented on a TM.
