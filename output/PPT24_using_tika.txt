Data Mining Functionalities
Data mining tasks can be classified into two categories: 
Descriptive
Predictive
Descriptive 
These tasks present the general properties of data stored in database.
The descriptive tasks are used to find out patterns in data.
E.g. : Cluster, correlation, trends etc. 
Predictive 
These tasks predict the value of one attribute on the bases of values of other attributes.
E.g. : Customer/Product prediction at sales store

Classification of Data Mining Systems
Classification according to the kinds of databases mined:
Classified according to different criteria (such as data models, or the types of data or applications involved), each of which may require its own data mining technique.
For instance, if classifying according to data models, we may have a relational, transactional, object-oriented, object-relational, or data warehouse mining system. 
If classifying according to the special data types, we may have a spatial, time-series, text or multimedia data mining system or a world-wide web mining system. 
Other system types include heterogeneous data mining systems and legacy data mining systems.

Data Mining—On what kind of data?
Relational Databases: 
A database system, also called a database management system (DBMS), consists of a collection of interrelated data, known as a database, and a set of software programs to manage and access the data.
E.g. : SQL Server, Oracle etc.
Data Warehouses: 
A data warehouse is a repository of information collected from multiple sources.
Data warehouses are constructed via a process of data cleaning, data integration, data transformation, data loading, and periodic data refreshing.
E.g. : Stock Market, D-Mart, Big Bazar etc.

Transactional Databases: 
Transactional database consists of a file where each record represents a transaction. 
A transaction typically includes a unique transaction identity number (TID) and a list of the items making up the transaction (such as items purchased in a store).
E.g. : Online shopping like Flipkart, Amazon etc.
Other Data 
Spatial data (Maps or Location)
Engineering design data (Design of Buildings, Offices Structures)

Data Mining Issues
Data mining issues can be classified into five categories: 
Mining Methodology
User Interaction
Efficiency and Scalability
Diversity of Database Types
Data Mining and Society

1) Mining Methodology
Mining various and new kinds of knowledge
Data mining covers a wide spectrum of data analysis and knowledge discovery tasks, so these tasks may use the same database in different ways and require the development of numerous data mining techniques.
Mining knowledge in multidimensional space
When searching for knowledge in large data sets, we can explore the data in multidimensional space.
That is, we can search for interesting patterns among combinations of dimensions (attributes) at varying levels of abstraction. Such mining is known as (exploratory) multidimensional data mining.


	Unit: 3 – Introduction to Data Mining (DM)		Darshan Institute of Engineering & Technology

‹#›

1) Mining Methodology (Cont..)
Data mining—an interdisciplinary effort
The power of data mining can be substantially enhanced by integrating new methods from multiple disciplines.
For example, to mine data with natural language text, it makes sense to fuse data mining methods of information retrieval and natural language processing.
Handling uncertainty, noise, or incompleteness of data
Data often contain noise, errors, exceptions, uncertainty or incomplete.
Errors and noise may confuse the data mining process, leading to the derivation of erroneous patterns.

2) User Interaction
Interactive mining
The data mining process should be highly interactive. Thus, it is important to build flexible user interfaces and an exploratory mining environment, facilitating the user’s interaction with the system. 
Incorporation of background knowledge
Background knowledge, constraints, rules, and other information regarding the domain under study should be incorporated into the knowledge discovery process.
Presentation and visualization of data mining results
How any system can present data mining results, vividly(clear image in mind) and flexibly ?, so that the discovered knowledge can be easily understood and directly usable by humans.

‹#›

3) Efficiency and Scalability
Efficiency and scalability of data mining algorithms
Data mining algorithms must be efficient and scalable in order to effectively extract information from huge amounts of data lies in many data repositories or in dynamic data streams.
In other words, the running time of a data mining algorithm must be predictable, short, and acceptable by applications.
Efficiency, scalability, performance, optimization, and the ability to execute in real time are key criteria for new mining algorithms.
Parallel, distributed, and incremental mining algorithms
The giant size of many data sets, the wide distribution of data, and the computational complexity of some data mining methods are factors that motivate the development of parallel and distributed data-intensive mining algorithms.

4) Diversity of Database Types
Handling complex types of data
Data mining is how to uncover knowledge from stream, time-series, sequence, graph, social network, and multirelational data.
In mining various types of attributes are available and also different types of data in database or dataset.
Mining dynamic, networked, and global data repositories
Data from multiple sources are connected by the Internet and various kinds of networks like distributed and heterogeneous global information systems.
The discovery of knowledge from different sources of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured challengeable.
Web Mining, multisource data mining and information network mining have become challenging and fast-evolving data mining fields.

5) Data Mining and Society 
Social impacts of data mining 
With data mining penetrating our everyday lives, it is important to study the impact of data mining on society, How can we used at a mining technology to benefit our society? How can we guard against its misuse? 
Privacy-preserving data mining
Data mining will help in scientific discovery, business management, economy recovery, and security protection (e.g., the real-time discovery of intruders and cyber attacks).
However, it poses the risk of disclosing an individual’s personal information.
Invisible data mining 
We cannot expect everyone in society to learn and master in data mining techniques.
For example, when purchasing items online, users may be unaware that the store is likely collecting data on the buying patterns of its customers, which may be used to recommend other items for purchase in the future.
