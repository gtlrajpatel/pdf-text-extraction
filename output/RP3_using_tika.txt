Natural language understanding1



In recent years speech recognition systems have made impressive advances 
in their ability to provide rich and natural interactions with callers. The term 
Natural Language (NL)—and its family of synonymous abbreviations: Natural 
Language Understanding (NLU), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and 
Natural Language Technology (NLT)—have been held up as the panacea for 
improving the accuracy of a speech system. Natural language suggests that, 
rather than constrain a caller to a list of choices, the caller can say anything in 
any context and be understood by the system. Speech vendors trumpet their 
NL capabilities, linguists at research labs talk about advancements in NLP 
technology, contact centers evaluating vendor proposals ask for explanations 
of available NLU features and industry press proclaim NLT as the future of 
speech recognition.

The problem is that the term “natural language” has become meaningless. 
This standard speech industry terminology is anything but standard. It implies 
that you could call up a travel service and say, “I’d like a flight to London for 
the 25th, for two adults, no wait make that two adults and an infant on my 
lap, and can I have two aisle seats next to each other?” The term natural 
language is vague and overused, full of promise, yet promising nothing. For it 
to mean something, one needs specifics.

In this paper, the specific benefits of natural language in speech recognition 
are explained and the approaches examined in detail. By the time you’ve 
finished reading, you’ll understand natural language and how it can be 
effective in improving the overall accuracy of your speech-based IVR system 
while providing callers a more engaging experience.

Speech-enabled automation
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems are at the heart of today’s contact 
center self-service solutions. Without IVR systems to automate calls, most 
contact centers would be overwhelmed by operating costs and by angry 
customers facing long queue times. But by automating common customer 
service requests, customers can resolve many issues quickly and agents can 
focus on helping the customers who truly need them.

Speech-enabled IVRs improve the overall automation rate of self-service 
systems. Unlike an IVR with only touchtone options, a speech-based self-ser-
vice system can handle more complex tasks, like updating an address, and 
can simplifying existing tasks to further increase automation. The resulting 
increase in automation rates mean more satisfied customers and lower costs 
for the contact center.

Nevertheless, the automation rate can only be as good as the accuracy 
during the caller’s entire interaction with a speech recognition system. 
Several recognition factors can limit the automation rate of a speech system.

Noisy backgrounds, confused callers, very heavy accents, and mumbled 
responses can make it hard for a system to complete a call. Of course, those 
factors can affect the ability of a live agent to complete those calls as well. 
And despite much advancement in technology, it is still possible for a speech 
recognition engine to simply make a mistake.

Learning to speak customer-ese
As all contact center agents know, callers truly believe they are speaking in 
a clear and obvious manner when they are explaining their concerns. In fact, 
each caller is really speaking in ‘customer-ese’, their own personal dialect 
that agents and IVR systems need to decode. This interpretation process 
is very similar to learning a new foreign language. To address the challenge 
many speech recognition systems have a list of acceptable phrases, known 
as the grammar, that the system is programmed to recognize at any given 
time. Grammars ensure that a speech recognition engine knows that the 
phrase “new to speech” is not a “nudist beach”, and that “agent,” “operator,” 
and “I want to speak to someone” all direct the caller to a live person.

If implementing a speech-enabled self-service system is like teaching a 
foreign language, then a grammar is like a translation book, mapping com-
mon phrases to their meaning. It works quite well… as long as people stick to 
those phrases. So what happens if a phrase is not in the book?

When a caller believes that a speech system has misrecognized his or her 
response, it is more likely that the caller spoke something which was out-of-
grammar—the system simply wasn’t expecting the caller to respond quite like 
that.

An analysis of a number of representative speech applications confirms that 
out-of-grammar errors outnumber misrecognition errors by a factor of as high 
as 5-to-1. Put simply, the problem is not recognizing what the caller said… 
it’s knowing what the caller meant. Therefore, to increase the accuracy of any 
system—improving its automation rate, making customers happier with the 
use of the system, and lowering overall costs for the contact center—a critical 
factor is to reduce these out-of-grammar errors.

So how can we teach a speech recognition system to speak this language 
of the customer? Different natural language capabilities provide different 
approaches to tackling that problem.

The Need for Natural Language
A Typical Example

CALLER:
I guess I’d like 
billing.

I said billing!  
Billing!  BILLING!

Would you like account information, 
billing, or technical support?

SYSTEM:

I’m sorry, I didn’t understand what 
you said...

I’m sorry, I didn’t understand what 
you said... please wait for the next 
available agent.



Make the translation book bigger
You can make the grammar contain a larger list of entries to appear like  
natural language is at work. This works best when trying to pick between 
a limited number of responses – for instance, a confirmation dialog may 
recognize yes, yup, you betcha, sure, heck yeah, as well as many other 
variations of a positive response.

This straightforward, brute-force technique can provide a semblance of 
natural language understanding. However, the approach has significant 
drawbacks as the list of possible responses gets longer and longer. It 
becomes harder to tune and maintain a system while keeping track of all 
these options. Even worse, it is possible for the overall performance of the 
system to decrease as the recognition engine struggles to compare the 
caller’s response to such a potentially confusing list of phrases.

The reality is that it is impossible to foresee and capture every conceivable 
response variant even in a very large grammar. To learn to speak customer- 
ese, the self-service system needs more natural language capabilities.

Learn to recognize variations of phrases
Since every caller expresses themselves in a unique manner, often adding 
extraneous information to their response, focusing on recognizing certain 
keywords is another approach for avoiding out-of-grammar errors and 
achieving higher automation rates.

Keyword spotting, sometimes referred to as robust parsing, is used when a 
caller says what the system is expecting but surrounds their response with 
filler phrases. Instead of simply saying “Yes” they may actually say “Um, I 
think so, yes”. The keyword spotting approach is most effective with short 
menus and yes/no dialogs which typically account for more than 70% of 
speech-enabled application interactions.

This statistical technique is based on comparing vocabularies of filler phrases 
created from transcriptions of previous calls or from classes of common 
phrases refined over time. Applying these vocabularies can provide an 
impressive 30% or more increase in recognition accuracy.

As callers have more flexibility in how they can exactly respond, the caller’s 
perceived accuracy is typically very high when using keyword spotting. As 
with any increase in accuracy, callers also appreciate interactions that avoid 
retry prompts and repeated confirmations.

Although the self-service system has already taken a big step towards 
learning to speak customer-ese, the caller’s responses are still limited to 
words that have been chosen for them rather than allowing them to use their 
own words. There are still more natural language capabilities to explore.

Become	fluent
Rather than focusing only on matches within and around a grammar, another 
approach for determining meaning is to ask callers to describe a problem in 
their own words.

This approach often begins by offering callers an open-ended prompt 
such as “how may I help you?” Callers respond by describing in their own 
words why they are calling, perhaps by saying “there’s a strange charge on 
my credit card statement”. The system then uses sophisticated statistical 
modeling to identify key phrases and look for a match in a list of example 
phrases that have known meanings. In this case, the likely meaning would be 
associated with billing even though the word ‘billing’ was never spoken.

SmartListener™ technology 
increases automation by interpreting 
the meaning of caller responses that 
include filler phrases that do not 
exactly match expected dialogs.

Although developing the detailed statistical models involves manual efforts to 
define and assign the agreed upon meanings to each transcription, the result 
is very high automation rates and high customer satisfaction. The key to 
extracting the correct meaning from this open-ended approach is the proper 
tagging of previously transcribed phrases. As with grammars, if the caller 
gives a completely unexpected response, like talking about ‘pizza toppings’ 
to an electricity provider’s system, there will not be a match.

When there is no match, the system will offer a fall-back alternative that 
uses traditional grammars to determine the caller’s intent such as “I’m sorry 
I did not get that, would you like mortgages, credit cards, …” Experience 
has shown that applying the keyword spotting approach to these fall-back 
grammars often leads to a successful interaction.

Appropriate for determining the meaning of any open-ended response, this 
powerful approach is highly effective for call routing applications. When 
callers use their own words, there tends to be drastically fewer zero-outs 
and misroutes as complicated menus are bypassed and confusing or arcane 
jargon is avoided.

Provide	a	more	flexible	script
Accurately recognizing the meaning of what a caller says is only part of how 
natural language can improve automation. The next step in learning to speak 
customer-ese is for the self-service system to have a conversation with the 
caller.

The conversational approach relies on dialogs that continuously adapt to 
the information provided. This way the caller has a personalized experience 
while they control the conversation. For example, callers often provide 
more information than prompted for. A system that can respond to varying 
amounts of information will have more productive and shorter calls. Notice in 
the dialog at the right the caller provides the ‘extra’ information of the return 
date allowing the system to avoid having to ask for it.

More than collecting information, a natural language conversation needs 
to flow smoothly. A system that constantly asks for confirmations creates a 
disjointed conversation that callers tend to reject. However systems that can 
handle corrections and verifications by dynamically embedding the confir-
mations in the next prompt are more engaging, leading to better automation 
rates. Notice in the dialog below how the system confirms the change to 
Boston when the caller requests a window seat.

Natural Language Understanding 
technology increases automation by 
correctly interpreting the meaning 
behind open-ended caller responses 
allowing callers to use their own words 
rather than words chosen for them.

This dialog flexibility is controlled by rules designed into prompts themselves 
so the system can respond and guide callers rather than dictate to them. 
Perhaps the defining characteristic of a natural language experience is 
engaging callers with intuitive and direct conversations.

Conclusion
In challenging economic conditions, the importance of cost-savings can not 
be underestimated. By applying effective natural language techniques to a 
speech-enabled self-service IVR system, automation rates will increase lead-
ing directly to lower costs. This paper has shown that different approaches to 
natural language can be applied throughout the caller’s interaction to achieve 
these improved automation rates. The three complementary natural language 
approaches of increasing the recognition accuracy within and around 
grammars, allowing callers to give open-ended responses, and interacting 
with adaptive dialogs all lead to more efficient and appealing calls.
