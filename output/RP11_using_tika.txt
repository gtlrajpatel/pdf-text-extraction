Abstract – In this paper, various machine learning algorithms
have been discussed. These algorithms are used for various 
purposes like data mining, image processing, predictive 
analytics, etc. to name a few. The main advantage of using 
machine learning is that, once an algorithm learns what to do 
with data, it can do its work automatically. 

Keywords – Machine learning, algorithms, pseudo code 

I. INTRODUCTION 

Machine learning is used to teach machines how to 
handle the data more efficiently. Sometimes after viewing 
the data, we cannot interpret the pattern or extract 
information from the data. In that case, we apply machine 
learning [1]. With the abundance of datasets available, the 
demand for machine learning is in rise. Many industries 
from medicine to military apply machine learning to extract 
relevant information. 

The purpose of machine learning is to learn from the 
data. Many studies have been done on how to make 
machines learn by themselves [2] [3]. Many 
mathematicians and programmers apply several approaches 
to find the solution of this problem. Some of them are 
demonstrated in Fig. 1. 

All the techniques of machine learning are explained in 
Section 2. Section 3 concludes this paper. 

II. TYPES OF LEARNING

A. Supervised Learning 

The supervised machine learning algorithms are those 
algorithms which needs external assistance. The input 
dataset is divided into train and test dataset. The train 
dataset has output variable which needs to be predicted or 
classified. All algorithms learn some kind of patterns from 
the training dataset and apply them to the test dataset for 
prediction or classification [4]. The workflow of supervised 
machine learning algorithms is given in Fig. 2. Three most 
famous supervised machine learning algorithms have been 
discussed here. 

1) Decision Tree: Decision trees are those type of trees
which groups attributes by sorting them based on their 
values. Decision tree is used mainly for classification 
purpose. Each tree consists of nodes and branches. Each 
nodes represents attributes in a group that is to be classified 
and each branch represents a value that the node can take 
[4]. An example of decision tree is given in Fig. 3. 

The pseudo code for Decision tree is described in Fig. 4; 
where S, A and y are training set, input attribute and target 
attribute respectively.

2) Naïve Bayes: Naïve Bayes mainly targets the text 
classification industry. It is mainly used for clustering and 
classification purpose [6]. The underlying architecture of 
Naïve Bayes depends on the conditional probability. It 
creates trees based on their probability of happening. These 
trees are also known as Bayesian Network. An example of 
the network is given in Fig. 5. The pseudo code is given in 
Fig. 6.

3) Support Vector Machine: Another most widely used 
state-of-the-art machine learning technique is Support 
Vector Machine (SVM). It is mainly used for classification. 
SVM works on the principle of margin calculation. It 
basically, draw margins between the classes. The margins 
are drawn in such a fashion that the distance between the

margin and the classes is maximum and hence, minimizing 
the classification error. An example of working and pseudo 
code of SVM is given in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively.

B. Unsupervised Learning 

The unsupervised learning algorithms learns few features 
from the data. When new data is introduced, it uses the 
previously learned features to recognize the class of the 
data. It is mainly used for clustering and feature reduction. 
An example of workflow of unsupervised learning is given 
in Fig. 9. 

 
Fig. 9. Example of Unsupervised Learning [10] 

The two main algorithms for clustering and 
dimensionality reduction techniques are discussed below. 

1) K-Means Clustering: Clustering or grouping is a type 
of unsupervised learning technique that when initiates, 
creates groups automatically. The items which possesses 
similar characteristics are put in the same cluster. This 
algorithm is called k-means because it creates k distinct 
clusters. The mean of the values in a particular cluster is the 
center of that cluster [9]. A clustered data is represented in 
Fig. 10. The algorithm for k-means is given in Fig. 11.

2) Principal Component Analysis 
In Principal Component Analysis or PCA, the dimension of 
the data is reduced to make the computations faster and 
easier. To understand how PCA works, let’s take an 
example of 2D data. When the data is being plot in a graph, 
it will take up two axes. PCA is applied on the data, the 
data then will be 1D. This is explained in Fig. 12. The 
pseudo code for PCA is discussed in Fig. 13.

C. Semi - Supervised Learning 

Semi – supervised learning algorithms is a technique 
which combines the power of both supervised and 
unsupervised learning. It can be fruit-full in those areas of 
machine learning and data mining where the unlabeled data 
is already present and getting the labeled data is a tedious 
process [15]. There are many categories of semi-supervised 
learning [16]. Some of which are discussed below: 

1) Generative Models: Generative models are one of the 
oldest semi-supervised learning method assumes a structure 
like p(x,y) = p(y)p(x|y) where p(x|y) is a mixed distribution 
e.g. Gaussian mixture models. Within the unlabeled data, 
the mixed components can be identifiable. One labeled 
example per component is enough to confirm the mixture 
distribution. 

2) Self-Training: In self-training, a classifier is trained 
with a portion of labeled data. The classifier is then fed with 
unlabeled data. The unlabeled points and the predicted 
labels are added together in the training set. This procedure 
is then repeated further. Since the classifier is learning 
itself, hence the name self-training. 

3) Transductive SVM: Transductive support vector 
machine or TSVM is an extension of SVM. In TSVM, the 
labeled and unlabeled data both are considered. It is used to 
label the unlabeled data in such a way that the margin is 
maximum between the labeled and unlabeled data. Finding 
an exact solution by TSVM is a NP-hard problem. 

 

D. Reinforcement Learning 

Reinforcement learning is a type of learning which 
makes decisions based on which actions to take such that 
the outcome is more positive. The learner has no knowledge 
which actions to take until it’s been given a situation. The 
action which is taken by the learner may affect situations 

and their actions in the future. Reinforcement learning 
solely depends on two criteria: trial and error search and 
delayed outcome [17]. The general model [18] for 
reinforcement learning is depicted in Fig. 14. 

 

 
Fig. 14. The Reinforcement Learning Model [18] 

In the figure, the agent receives an input i, current state s, 
state transition r and input function I from the environment. 
Based on these inputs, the agent generates a behavior B and 
takes an action a which generates an outcome. 

E. Multitask Learning 

Multitask learning has a simple goal of helping other 
learners to perform better. When multitask learning 
algorithms are applied on a task, it remembers the 
procedure how it solved the problem or how it reaches to 
the particular conclusion. The algorithm then uses these 
steps to find the solution of other similar problem or task. 
This helping of one algorithm to another can also be termed 
as inductive transfer mechanism. If the learners share their 
experience with each other, the learners can learn 
concurrently rather than individually and can be much 
faster [19]. 

F. Ensemble Learning 

When various individual learners are combined to form 
only one learner then that particular type of learning is 
called ensemble learning. The individual learner may be 
Naïve Bayes, decision tree, neural network, etc. Ensemble 
learning is a hot topic since 1990s. It has been observed 
that, a collection of learners is almost always better at doing 
a particular job rather than individual learners [20]. Two 
popular Ensemble learning techniques are given below 
[21]: 

1) Boosting: Boosting is a technique in ensemble 
learning which is used to decrease bias and variance. 
Boosting creates a collection of weak learners and convert 
them to one strong learner. A weak learner is a classifier 
which is barely correlated with true classification. On the 
other hand, a strong learner is a type of classifier which is 
strongly correlated with true classification [21]. The pseudo 
code for AdaBoost (which is most popular example of 
boosting) is give in Fig. 15.

2) Bagging: Bagging or bootstrap aggregating is applied 
where the accuracy and stability of a machine learning 
algorithm needs to be increased. It is applicable in 
classification and regression. Bagging also decreases 
variance and helps in handling overfitting [23]. The pseudo 
code for bagging in given in Fig. 16.

G. Neural Network Learning 
The neural network (or artificial neural network or ANN) 

is derived from the biological concept of neurons. A neuron 
is a cell like structure in a brain. To understand neural 
network, one must understand how a neuron works. A 
neuron has mainly four parts (see Fig. 17). They are 
dendrites, nucleus, soma and axon.  

 
Fig. 17. A Neuron [24] 

The dendrites receive electrical signals. Soma processes 
the electrical signal. The output of the process is carried by 
the axon to the dendrite terminals where the output is sent 
to next neuron. The nucleus is the heart of the neuron. The 
inter-connection of neuron is called neural network where 
electrical impulses travel around the brain.  

 
Fig. 18. Structure of an Artificial Neural Network [24] 

An artificial neural network behaves the same way. It 
works on three layers. The input layer takes input (much 
like dendrites). The hidden layer processes the input (like 
soma and axon). Finally, the output layer sends the 
calculated output (like dendrite terminals) [24]. There are 
basically three types of artificial neural network: 
supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement [25]. 

1) Supervised Neural Network: In the supervised neural 
network, the output of the input is already known. The 
predicted output of the neural network is compared with the 
actual output. Based on the error, the parameters are 
changed, and then fed into the neural network again. Fig. 19 
will summarize the process. Supervised neural network is 
used in feed forward neural network. 

 
Fig. 19. Supervised Neural Network [25] 

2) Unsupervised Neural Network: Here, the neural 
network has no prior clue about the output the input. The 
main job of the network is to categorize the data according 
to some similarities. The neural network checks the 
correlation between various inputs and groups them. The 
schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 20. 

 
Fig. 20. Unsupervised Neural Network [25] 

3) Reinforced Neural Network: In reinforced neural 
network, the network behaves as if a human communicates 
with the environment. From the environment, a feedback 
has been provided to the network acknowledging the fact 
that whether the decision taken by the network is right or

wrong. If the decision is right, the connections which points 
to that particular output is strengthened. The connections 
are weakened otherwise. The network has no previous 
information about the output. Reinforced neural network is 
represented in Fig. 21.

H. Instance-Based Learning 

In instance-based learning, the learner learns a particular 
type of pattern. It tries to apply the same pattern to the 
newly fed data. Hence the name instance-based. It is a type 
of lazy learner which waits for the test data to arrive and 
then act on it together with training data. The complexity of 
the learning algorithm increases with the size of the data. 
Given below is a well-known example of instance-based 
learning which is k-nearest neighbor [26]. 

1) K-Nearest Neighbor: In k-nearest neighbor (or KNN), 
the training data (which is well-labeled) is fed into the 
learner. When the test data is introduced to the learner, it 
compares both the data. k most correlated data is taken from 
training set. The majority of k is taken which serves as the 
new class for the test data [27]. The pseudo code for KNN 
is given in Fig. 22.

Today each and every person is using machine learning 
knowingly or unknowingly. From getting a recommended 
product in online shopping to updating photos in social 
networking sites. This paper gives an introduction to most 
of the popular machine learning algorithms.
