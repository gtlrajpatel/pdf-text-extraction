3  Introduction
INTRODUCTIONIT decision makers are on the front lines of gathering, sorting, and analyzing 
big data in order to equip their organizations to make the best business 
decisions today, and tomorrow
. While IT departments have access to more
 data and more tools than ever, the sheer amount of information being
 generated, and the growing number of applications and platforms available 
to harness and understand that information, make managing advanced 
data analytics a challenge for many IT professionals
.Big data analytics can deliver efficiency and speed, with the ability to 
identify insights for instant and informed decision-making
. This enables an 
organization to work more quickly and productively, stay agile, and even 
gain a competitive advantage
. But there are challenges that come with big data as well, from segmenting 
useful data from clusters and identifying the right data stores and platforms 
to eliminating problematic data silos and finding and integrating the best 
big data tools into your architecture

THE DATA LAN
DSCAPEAs the volume of data grows exponentially, from the heart of enterprise 
data centers to the cloud and the outer edges of the network, IT departments
 must learn to extract value from data more quickly and accurately than 
ever before
. A highly optimized and scalable platform for analytics is necessary to support
 the complex compute requirements of increasingly heavy and diverse 
data workloadsŠfrom traditional business intelligence (BI) and structured 

and machine learning
.  
types, both structured and unstructured, across disparate systems
. This is necessary for businesses to extract timely value for actionable insight 
as well as faster networks
. In fact, every domain of infrastructure must be
 transformed to handle the extreme demands that advanced data workloads
 will place on compute, memory, storage, interconnect, and I/O subsystems 
in data centers
.

beyond traditional data analytics and embark upon more critical and high-
value initiatives, including machine learning and AI
.This requires leveraging intelligence from widely distributed sources in order 

that can be used to make better business decisions at every opportunity

5  The Data Landscape
 
While analytics continue to evolve rapidly, it™s important to know the types 
of analytics that organizations are working to capture and leverage today. 


Ł 
 Summarizes historical data; answers questions 
about what happened in the pastŁ 
 Examines data to gain insight into why things 
happenedŁ 
 Analyzes both new and historical data to forecast 
activity, behavior, and trends
Ł 
 Uses data techniques such as simulation or 
machine learning to identify the best course of action for a given situation
Ł 
 Leverages AI technologies and high-performance 
data analytics to automate decisions or augment human decisions
While most companies typically use the traditional analytic techniques of
 descriptive and diagnostic analytics, they have not yet moved up to the 
advanced analytics of predictive, prescriptive, and cognitive analytics. 
By moving up to this higher level of data analytics that leverages machine 
learning and AI, companies can utilize the power and sophistication of 
advanced analytics to provide natural interaction-based collaboration, 
where human experience is augmented with smart machines to offer 
breakthrough insights for businesses.

6  The Data Landscape

An analytics solution stack
 is a bundled set of programs and application 
software put together to produce a desired result. The technologies 
and applications of each component work together, often in a sequential 
manner, to create functional programs that deliver advanced analytics 
solutions.


The foundation for acquiring, storing, and protecting data, as well 
 as for running commercial and open source analytics solutions

Relational databases are often supplemented by Hadoop Distributed 
File System (HDFS), which can form the basis of enterprise data hubs 
or data lakes

Building blocks for the analytic end-user application, and may 




Out-of-the-box analytics applications that provide analytics to the 
various user types of dataThe four layers of a solution stack should complement each other as 

management systems to deliver traditional and advanced analytics. 
Other technologies, such as AI and performance and security solutions, 
run through all the layers of the solution stack, accelerating advanced 
analytics insights, and protecting your data.

7  The Data Landscape

Work Together?
The internet of things (IoT) is creating a world of connectedness we 
could never have imagined even a decade ago. 
Big data
 describes the 
incredibly large volumes of information being processed, and how this 
information in an almost endless source of insights about the digital 
world and how people interact with technology. This data is ideally 
suited for analysis, and can be used to understand trends and make 
critical predictions.
Yet as more people connect to more devices in more ways, there is no
 
pace that is quick enough to be useful. Which is why there is increasing 

developments in computing, AI has become a fundamental tool for a 
wide range of technologies, including robotics, medicine, communication, 
and the previously mentioned IoT. 
With IT departments being expected to manage all of the extremely 
complex issues associated with big data, they needed a better technology 
solution to address these issues. The answer: AI. Sorting and analyzing 
all the intricacies of big data may be too much for even large teams 
of IT pros, but AI can cut through the clutter to automatically analyze 

hidden in big data, so organizations can use those insights to improve 
everything from provisioning servers to improving customer service.

8  Making a Plan for your Organization

Ł How does data flow into your organization?
Ł How is data shared across departments?
MAKING A PLAN FOR 
YOUR ORGANIZATION
Planning is critical in the use of data analytics to spur innovation, create 
better customer experiences, and drive business
. You must be prepared to 
maximize your analytics capabilities by developing a modern data center 
infrastructure to keep up with the growing velocity and volume of data
. 
your organization and how it is shared and utilized across departments
. This will enable your organization to utilize increasingly sophisticated 
analytic techniques to gain rapid, actionable insights
.You also need a comprehensive analytics strategy to address the distributed 
nature of data from the cloud to the edge and examine key infrastructure 
capabilities needed to support a broad range of analyticsŠfrom traditional 
to real-time big data analytics to machine learningŠwith higher levels of 
data protection
. 

that are overwhelmed by data from those that know how to use data as a 
powerful business tool

on a global level. But those insights can only come from better ways 

a ﬁholisticﬂ approach to analytics. 


 Enterprises must get their data layer 
right from the start. Successful enterprise analytics requires 
eliminating data ﬁsilos,ﬂ and providing highly structured and 
enforced data governance, integrity, and quality.

 Faster time to value was the number
 one requirement that executives wanted from their analytics 
infrastructure, according to a 2016 Forrester survey.
2 By 
accelerating the insights from that data, companies are better 
prepared to drive business growth and innovation.  
   
 Increasingly, disciplines such as advanced 
analytics and AI are merging.  Forward-thinking organizations 
are already taking steps to achieve this integration. The value 
created will leave less-prepared competitors in their wake.
