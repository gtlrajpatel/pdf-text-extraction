To implement AI within your organization successfully you 
need to understand what AI is, where it currently stands, 

what value can provide to businesses and how it can be 

successfully adopted. This white paper is written for 

business leaders looking for practical advice on how to 

leverage arti˜cial intelligence (AI) for their organizations. 
The fact that AI has been hyped doesn™t take away from its 
capabilities as a real value driver. Heavy investments have 

been made in AI across multiple industries; the Chinese 

government even made it one of their core sectors. And 

companies like IBM, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are 

leading the pack when it comes to utilizing data and AI. 
AI provides enormous amounts of value in multiple 
industries. Because of its high value potential, many 

companies have been scrambling to implement AI within 

their organizations. And the projects, when implemented 

properly, have shown signi˜cant returns and improved 

competitive edge. If your company hasn™t started 

implementing AI, it may lag behind its competitors, so it™s 

critical to evaluate what AI can do for your organization. 

But this doesn™t mean you should hire data scientists or 

acquiring data science solutions without a clear strategy. 

Implementing AI should be a carefully thought out process. 

Otherwise it may turn out to be a costly failure. 
The authors of this paper want to provide you with the 
knowledge you need to evaluate what type of AI solutions you 

can implement to give your company a competitive advantage.

     3What is AI?
When people hear AI they often think about sentient 
robots and magic boxes. AI today is much more mundane 

and simpleŠbut that doesn™t mean it™s not powerful. 

Another misconception is that high-pro˜le research 

projects can be applied directly to any business situation. 
 AI done right can create extreme return on investments 

(ROIs)Šfor instance through automation or precise 

prediction. But it does take thought, time and proper 

implementation. We have seen that success and value 

generated by AI projects is increased when there is a 

grounded understanding and expectation of what the 

technology can deliver from the C-suite down.
We are now at the brink of the fourth Industrial Revolution. 
AI is one of the biggest facets of this revolution, and it 

will affect almost all sectors, as did previous Industrial 

Revolutions.
1 AI™s abilities have increased significantly 
since its inception in 1955; it can now detect patterns 

more accurately, continuously and based on more data. 

Currently, AI has surpassed human intelligence in some 

specific domains. These domains can be split in three 

categories: general tasks, formal tasks and expert tasks. 

General tasks could include visual recognition, speech 

recognition, natural language processing and translation. 

Formal tasks are related to games where some theorem 

and learning is involved. And expert tasks are those that 

would otherwise be executed by a domain expert. (Think 

of tasks such as diagnosing disease and engineering.
2) As already stated, AI was ˜rst named in 1955 and was 

de˜ned as the ability of machines to perform human-like 

tasks. The term has gained popularity ever since its ˜rst 

mention. However, there is still quite a bit of confusion about 

the difference between AI, machine learning and deep 

learningŠbut simply stated, AI encompasses the latter two.

act and adapt.

which multipayered neutral

ﬁArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a science and a set of 

computational technologies that are inspired byŠbut 

typically operate quite differently fromŠthe ways people 

use their nervous systems and bodies to sense, learn, 

reason and take action.ﬂ
3 Lately there has been a big rise in 
the day-to-day use of machines powered by AI. These 

machines are wired using cross-disciplinary approaches 

based on mathematics, computer science, statistics, 

psychology and more.
4 Virtual assistants are becoming 
more common, most of the web shops predict your 

purchases, many companies make use of chatbots in their 

customer service and many companies use algorithms to 

detect fraud. These are just a few of the examples of how 

AI is used every day.

Machine learning Machine learning is enabling a machine to learn from data 

without explicitly programming it with rules, because it can 

learn from the data it™s given. In essence, you could build 

an AI consisting of many different rules and it would also be 

able to be AI. But instead of programming all the rules, you 

feed the algorithm data and let the algorithm adjust itself to 

improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Traditional science 

algorithms mainly process, whereas machine learning is 

about applying an algorithm to ˜t a model to the data. 

Examples of machine-learning algorithms that are used a 

lot and that you might be familiar with are decision trees, 

random forest, Bayesian networks, K-mean clustering, 

neural networks, regression, arti˜cial neural networks, 

deep learning and reinforcement learning. Arti˜cial neural 

networks and deep learning have recently become more 

common machine learning algorithms.
Implementation examples would be predicting stock market 
prices or predicting whether a customer will churn from 

your company. 
Deep learning Deep learning (DL) is a relatively new set of methods that 

is changing machine learning in fundamental ways. DL isn™t 

an algorithm per se, but rather a family of algorithms that 

implements deep networks (many layers). These networks 

are so deep that new methods of computation, such as 

graphics processing units (GPUs), are required to train 

them, in addition to clusters of compute nodes. 
DL works very well with large amounts data, and whenever 
 a problem is too complex to understand and engineer 
features (due to unstructured data, for instance). DL almost 

always outperforms the other types of algorithms when it 

comes to image classi˜cation, natural language processing 

and speech recognition. An example would be recognizing 

melanoma or conducting machine translation, which was 

not possible using previous techniques. 
Figure 2
: Deep neural network with ˜ve layers.
5Currently, the larger the neural network and the more data 

that can be added to it, the better the performance a neural 

network can provide. DL is very powerful, but it has a couple 

of drawbacks. It™s almost impossible to determine why the 

system came to a certain conclusion. This is called the 

ﬁblack boxﬂ problem, though there are now many available 

techniques that can increase insights in the inner workings 
 
of the DL model. Also, deep learning often requires extensive 

training times, a lot of data and speci˜c hardware 

requirements, and it™s not easy to acquire the speci˜c 

skills needed to develop a new DL solution to a problem.
In conclusion, there is no one algorithm that can ˜t or solve 
all problems. Success really depends on the problem you 

need to solve and the data you have available. Sometimes 
 
a problem will need a hybrid approach, where you use 

multiple algorithms to solve the problem. Each problem 

requires extensive investigation of what constitutes a 

best-˜t type of algorithm. You should take into account 

transparency and how much data, capabilities and time 

you have, because some algorithms take a long time to run.

     5How does an AI system learn?  
To illustrate how AI system learning works, we™ll next 
describe what a data scientist does, and what a machine 

does in the process of developing AI solutions. Later, when 

we discuss the pitfalls of implementing AI, we™ll explain 

what types of skills you™ll need to successfully build a data 
science team.  
Data scientist
The data scientist extracts knowledge and interprets data 

by using the right tools and statistical methods
6. The data 
scientist ˜rst helps identify data-analytics problems. Next, 

he or she defines defines the right algorithm and tools. 

He or she cleans the data and collects the correct data for 

the problem. The next step is to de˜ne hyperparameters 
and engineer the features in a way that it ˜ts the model. 
After the model provides output the data scientist analyzes 

and identi˜es patterns and trends. Then the data scientist 

communicates the results to the stakeholders.
MachineThe machine learns to recognize patterns in the data 
 that it is fed to it, and then maps these patterns to future 

outcomes. The machine learns through adjusting the 

weights and biases in the network from feedback to get to 
the correct outcome. This feedback must come from a 
trainerŠthe data scientist. The data scientist tells the 

model what should happen and what shouldn™t happen. 

This correction is then sent back through the network and 

an error rate is computed. With each iteration, the model 

works to decrease the error rate.  
In the appendix section of this paper, we have a section 

that addresses the different types of algorithms™ learning. 

There are four main types of learning; supervised, 

unsupervised, transferred and reinforcement learning. 

While unsupervised, reinforcement and transfer learning 

show great potential, supervised learning is currently the 

type that can provide the highest economic value.
What has driven the development of AI?
With increasing computing power and more data, the 

potential value of algorithms became higher. People and 

companies saw possibilities to embed these smart systems 

into their companies to drive strategy and innovation. As 

the power of algorithms, computing and amounts of data 
increased companies started to see an increasing amount 
of use cases. AI started to become an essential value. 

Companies saw that these systems could move them closer 

to their customers, drive ef˜ciency, enhance employee 

experience and capability, automatize tasks, decrease 

costs and improve revenue. 
But AI went through some lulls and spikes before it became 
capable of enabling so many bene˜ts. At a certain point the 

general public gave up on AI and machine learning as a whole, 
which stalled developments and investments. For instance, 
when Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 

worked together with Carnegie Mellon to implement speech 

recognition for their pilots, they cut the project in 1974 after 

having spent millions of dollars on it. From the 1960s to 1974, 

the main funding for AI came from governments. But after 

1974 there was barely any government funding because

of multiple failed AI projects, so the belief in the feasibility of 
AI declined. But after this period, improvements in ef˜ciency 

lead to successful business cases, once again proving 

value. Today we now see AI as one of the big value drivers 

for companies, and to compete most companies must adopt 

AI strategies. Three topics have made AI available for many 

companies right now:  
 ŠThe evolution of data: 
A factor contributing to the 

massive adoption of AI is the exponential growth of 

available data. With the introduction of the Internet, 

social media, proliferation of sensors and smart devices, 

and the fact that data storage became cheaper, it became 

more accessible than ever before. 
 ŠThe evolution of algorithms:
 Algorithms have been 

around since we could write. Recently, the development 

of more advanced algorithms has helped AI become 

more powerful and ef˜cient.
 ŠThe evolution of computing:
 Another major factor in 

AI™s current success is its computing power. Back when 

AI was just beginning to be developed, the computing 

power was minimal. Computers nowadays can take much 

more data and heavier algorithms than in the 1950s. 
These developments would not have taken place without 

signi˜cant investments and proven business value.

     7Where are we today with AI? 
We can split the term AI into three categories: general, 
broad and narrow. General AI encompasses all the human-

like capabilities, whereas narrow AI can only do a certain 

taskŠand it can do it quite wellŠbut narrow AI can™t 

transfer its knowledge to different sorts of problems. 
Narrow AI
Narrow AI is focused on addressing very focused tasks 

(such as buying a book with a voice-based device) based 

on ﬁcommon knowledge.ﬂ That™s the reason narrow AI is 

scaling very quickly in the consumer world where there are 

a lot of common tasks and data to train these systems. 

Narrow or weak AI is, contrary to the naming, very powerful 
 at routine jobs. 
Figure 4
: The three categories of AI.
Narrow
2010-2015Broad  
(AI for Enterprise)
We are here
General AI2050 and beyond
Broad AI

What we see today in self driving cars is still de˜ned as narrow 

AI. You can see it as a collection of narrow AI systems that 

make decisions. This is what we call broad AI. Another 

example of broad AI includes a system within a bank that 

analyzes the balance sheet of corporate customers to 

recommend the best currency hedging strategy. Another 

example would be a system that supports engineers who 

work on complex maintenance tasks on a platform in the 

middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Broad AI is about integrating 

AI within a speci˜c business process of an enterprise where 

you need business- and enterprise-speci˜c knowledge and 

data to train this type of system. These tasks are very different 

from the narrow AI used in the consumer world because the 

data and knowledge available in the enterprise are much more 

limited in terms of volumes, very industry speci˜c and in most 

of the cases private (for example owned by an enterprise). 

This is what we believe is currently the most valuable type of 

AI currently for the enterprise. 
General AI
General AI is far from reaching its potential. The expectations 

are that it will take at least another couple of decades. General 

AI refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task 

a human can. Currently AI does not have the ability to think 

abstractly, strategize and use previous experiences to come 

up with new creative ideas as humans do.
Some people think we will have general AI in a couple of 
decades others like IBM™s Rob High and Google™s Peter Norvig 

believe we don™t need broad AI at all.

What are the areas in which AI provides
 the most value today?
While relevant AI use cases span various areas across 
virtually every industry, there are three main macro domains 

that continue to drive the adoption as well as the most 

economies across businesses. They are:
 ŠCognitive engagement: Involves how to deliver new ways 

for humans to engage with machines, moving from pure 

digital experiences (such as the ability to run transactions 

digitally) into human-like natural conversations.
 ŠCognitive insights and knowledge: Addresses how to 

augment humans who are overwhelmed with information 

and knowledge.
 ŠCognitive automation: Relates to how to move from process 

automation to mimicking human intelligence to facilitate 

complex and knowledge-intense business decisions.
What are some examples of successful 
implementations?
There™s a vast amount of problems AI is already addressing 
to deliver business value across the three macro domains 

described in the previous section. We want to explain 
 a couple of use cases our IBM team has successfully 

completed to demonstrate where AI can bring value.
Manufacturer: engine anomaly detection using 
 a neural network 

Using the many different available sensor measurements 

from large truck engines, a neural network was trained to 

recognize normal and abnormal engine behavior. In the 

huge, high dimensional (many variables) dataset the 

neural network learned the natural correlations and 

relationships between all different readings. The resulting 
model was able to predict ﬁnormalﬂ values given certain 

operating conditions and could thus also be used to detect 

when speci˜c measurements were out of the ordinary. 

Anomalous sensor readings are highly predictive of 

pending engine failures.
Car manufacturer: predictive failure detection for welding 
robots and predictive maintenance assessment

Through supervised learning techniques, predictive models 

were developed that could provide an early warning of 

failure based on the different system messages and sensor 

readings that continuously stream from the production line. 

This early warning could be used to prioritize maintenance 

and reduce both downtime as well as false positives and 

needless efforts. Working through this ˜rst proof of value, 

the data scientists uncovered many data quality challenges 

that could be worked around to realize more value.

     9Utility company: micro-grid energy forecasting and 
production mix optimization
The output of machine learning-based predictive models 
with prescriptive, mathematical optimization models to 
prescribe the optimal mix of power production sources to 
meet predicted demand and to minimize costs. This required 
both the prediction of demand as well as prediction of 
available solar and wind energy capacity.
Material producer: insights dashboard
IBM worked with the client™s sourcing experts to understand 
the business dynamics and create inventory of possibly 
relevant data sources. Several machine learning models 
were then trained to learn the price behavior and forecast 
future price development. The models also enabled 
buyers to evaluate their own ﬁwhat ifﬂ scenarios. This was 
further supplemented with IBM® Watson Discovery News 
service, which identi˜ed the most relevant news articles 
related to the material of interest. This all came together 
for the user in an interactive dashboard to consume the 
insights and interact with the data and models to make 
buying decisions.
Best practices to successfully 
 implement AI within an organization 
Let™s discuss what you need to do before implementing AI. 
Currently, many companies are scrambling to implement AI 
within their environments because they believe it will keep 
them ahead of the gameŠwhich, if thought through, is the 
case. But here are a few steps you need to take.
We™ve de˜ned three main steps to implement AI in your 
company. These steps are:
 ŠDevelop an AI strategy and roadmap
 ŠEstablish AI capabilities and skills
 ŠStart small and scale quickly
Develop an AI strategy and roadmap
First, it™s important to understand AI and to research what 
it can and can™t do for your organization. You can get more 
familiar with AI by collaborating with a data scientist, because 
it™s important that the C-level has a good understanding of 
 AI and its implementation dif˜culties before they de˜ne 
where and how to implement. What often happens if AI
 is not holistically understood the overall project won™t 
provide value.
Once AI is understood, the next question you should ask 
yourself is: ﬁWhat speci˜c problem do I want to solve, or what 
opportunity do I want to take?ﬂ Is your company looking to 
drive ef˜ciency in the back of˜ce, differentiate its digital 
proposition, generate new revenue streams by leveraging 
customers™ insights or even reinvent its entire business? 

**End Page**
10     Beyond the hype: A guide to understanding and successfully implementing arti˜cial intelligence within your business
After having thought this through, you™ll probably have 
many different use cases. At this point, it™s critical to 
prioritize these cases into a transformation roadmap that 
covers both a long-term vision as well as concrete feasible 
quick wins. Next, you should think about what data you 
have available. To solve most of the problems with AI you 
need to have relevant data. Without data, AI will not provide 
any value. For many companies it™s a task in and of itself 
to keep track of the type of dataŠas well as where it™s 
stored and in what way. Often the first step will be to 
understand the data you currently have and the type you 
need to implement your AI case.
Establish AI capabilities and skills
AI requires a completely new set of capabilities and skills 
which may be in short supply in your organization. To build 
the required in-house AI skills, it™s important to plan, 
establish and grow a dedicated Center of Competence or 
leverage the IBM Garage concept to perform in partnership. 
Not only this dedicated team is important, but you also 
need to assure the right mindset and way of working in the 
rest of the organization. It™s critical that these functions 
occur in conjunction with developing and integrating an AI 
platform within your current IT architecture to implement 
and scale AI.Start small and scale quickly
 ŠStart with minimal valuable products (MVPs) 
 In this phase you want to bring in experts to help quickly 
develop solutions to your business problems. This can 
only be done once the before-mentioned steps are 
completed and the business is ready organizationally 
and technologically. This also means that the experts 
you bring in should be both business and technologically 
savvy. A good duration for a MVP is normally between two 
and three months. Our experience shows that starting 
with large-scale, complex and very long AI implementation 
projects normally lead to failure. 
 ŠSet understandable key performance indicators (KPIs)
 To make sure that a project will succeed, you need to 
de˜ne KPIs that are understandable for your businessŠ
including employees and other stakeholders. These KPIs 
will help you evaluate whether a project is successful. In 
general, we suggest taking a second look at these KPIs 
after an appropriate duration to decide whether the 
project is successful or if you should discontinue it. If 
your business can™t pinpoint the right KPIs to measure 
success, the project is too complex.
 ŠRoll-out through company (culture)
 Once agreement is reached about which projects would 
be worth working on, it™s time to implement the MVP 
within your company. It™s important that the way you 
implement it is looked at from both the business and 
the technical side.

     11Pitfalls of AI implementation
With the experience of implementing many of these 
 cases we normally see a couple of problems organizations 
have when implementing AI. We™ve listed them because 
we feel it™s important to know what you should consider 
when implementing AI. 
Culture
Pitfalls: 
Looking at the advances we™ve made over the last 
decade, gathering data is easy. But it™s what™s done with 
the data that provides the most value. The biggest pitfall 
we often encounter is a culture that™s not committed to 
making data-driven decisions. Examples are cultures that 
can™t innovate in an agile fashion or can™t leave room for 
trial and error, as are cultures that have traditionally been 
unwilling to transform a process. This reluctance usually 
has to do with fear of job loss, skepticism or a knowledge 
gap. It™s a challenge to get your organization ready to 
embrace a data-driven culture, and for many of your 
employees it can feel like a counter intuitive process. 
Recommendation:
 Digital change management, training 
and preparation for the shift in thinking is required. You 
should start with small wins that are visible for relevant 
departments. The business users should be your starting 
point for agile development and in your design thinking 
process. All the results that come out of the project should 
be measurable; this way you can easily show your wins. 
Then, for a data-driven culture to take hold, the whole 
organization must embrace it. The message must be clear 
for all employees: ﬁDecision are made based on data.ﬂ
Building trust within the company
Pitfalls: 
This step is often overlooked, but when you want 
to implement AI you need get project stakeholders involved 
and on board. In Design Thinking, IBM starts with the 
business and its users. A data scientist will require domain 
knowledge and access to data, and the stakeholders should 
accommodate this need to help to speed up the process. 
Also, consider the need for AI education and devote time 
to considering the right user interface. 
Recommendation: 
Use a form of change management to 
establish user adoption. IBM™s best practice is to leverage 
its digital change approach to involve the users in the 
development of the project through studio™s in which we 
envision and co-create together. AI is not something 
everyone will be able to grasp immediately. Working with 
AI should therefore be carefully implemented in the 
business environment. 
Expectation management
Pitfalls:
 In many cases we work on, we see that employees 
or other stakeholders don™t believe in AI or think it™s a magical 
box we take from our of˜ce that will quickly solve all the 
problems a company. This leads to disappointment when 
an AI project is not delivered in a short timeframe or if it 
doesn™t deliver the expected results. And this disappointment 
can lead to a lack of belief that will eventually diminish 
the will to implement AI and experience the bene˜ts of its 
long-term possibilities. 
Recommendation:
 Start with developing a solid strategy 
and roadmap. De˜ne where you need to go and what you 
need to add to the organization to get there. First steps 
often include mundane items such as data governance and 
warehousing, but you need to take these steps to properly 
implement AI. It™s therefore important to implement proper 
change management to guide the company.

12     Beyond the hype: A guide to understanding and successfully implementing arti˜cial intelligence within your business
Bad data
Pitfalls: 
One problem we often come across is bad-quality 
data. This problem derails, limits and complicates many 
machine learning and AI projects. Bad or ﬁdirtyﬂdata can 
mean ˜elds are missing, that there are duplicates in the 
data, or that it™s outdated data, contains spelling or 
punctuation errors and is generally incorrect. As we are 
moving toward more data-driven decision making in 
enterprises, it™s absolutely essential to have clean data. 
Outcomes derived from bad data will lead to incorrect 
decision making.  
Recommendation:
 To overcome incorrect decision making 
based on bad data we suggest the enterprise incorporate 
standardization of data, monitoring of data, cleaning of 
incoming data and a centralized control of data. 
SponsorshipPitfalls: 
When implementing an AI strategy, it™s important 
that the right people, such as department heads, CxOs or 
managers support the project. Implementing AI through the 
organization can be a long process, and without support of 
the right people there™s a higher probability that the project 
will fail. What you might see when this problem occurs is 
that your employees might not put enough time into problem 
de˜nition and subject knowledge sharing. 
Recommendation: 
Align the right people before you start 
in a ﬁgarageﬂ concept. The key stakeholders should be 
identi˜ed and should bring input and willingness to the 
table. Create buy-in and support with employees, other 
stakeholders, management and C-suite.
Lack of capabilities
 Pitfalls: 
Many companies want to implement machine 
learning right off the bat. But to implement AI, you need to 
look at two things: the ˜rst is acquiring or outsourcing your 
own data science talent, and the second is looking at your 
current IT infrastructure. 
If you choose the in-house route, you™re taking a more 
challenging route. This option can be very rewarding but 
it™s important to take in account that it will require more 
time to set up infrastructures, pipelines and research. If 
you decide to take this route, you™ll need to acquire the 
following skills in house:  
 ŠResearchers to create new solutions to your products
 ŠProject managers to keep the team on track
 ŠDomain experts who have knowledge about your 
products, customers and the business environment 
surrounding the product
 ŠData engineers and machine learning engineers who 
can scale the algorithms 
 ŠData analysts who can process the outcome
 ŠStatisticians to help ensure quality results
 ŠSoftware engineers to turn all you™ve created into 
something that can be used by the massesŠbe it your 
customers or your employees 
While these roles don™t all need to be ˜lled by individual 
employees, it™s essential to have all these skills in house. 
The second option is easier and quicker to implement. In 
this case you™d make use of the capabilities of an external 
party such as through the IBM Garage offering, which can 
give you the ability to use these capabilities without having 
to set up a complete internal department.
 
**End Page**
IBM Services
     13Recommendation: 
Before starting an AI project, you should 
evaluate the capabilities you currently have inhouse, and 
then de˜ne the cost you™ll occur acquiring the capabilities 
needed to close any gaps. Then you can de˜ne whether you 
want to hire these capabilities internally or use an external 
experienced resource to access the required capabilities.
Scalability Pitfalls: 
To properly scale the correct architecture, 
integration and employees that know how to use them 
need be in place. Many data scientists believe that the 
research and development (R&D) of a data science project 
is similar to a scaled IT implementation, yet the two are 
very different. Also, because there is increasing enterprise 
demand for AI, organizations want to analyze large amounts 
of data. This can require quite a bit of time to train an 
algorithmŠdays or even weeks depending on the amount 
of data involved. We still encounter data scientists trying 
to perform this function on their laptops.
9 Recommendation: 
Develop a plan to set up the correct 
 AI architecture, a platform to deploy to, a data integration 
strategy and properly trained data scientists.
Not enough (available) data
 Pitfalls: 
Data availability depends on the company and on 
how it stores data. Some organizations have the data but 
don™t have it readily available. Large corporations are 
challenged to locate and keep track of the right data. 
Smaller companies may be challenged by the amount of 
data they produce.
 Recommendation: 
Not all problems need machine learning 
and AI. If you ˜nd yourself in a situation where you don™t 
have enough data, you should carefully consider if you 
should launch your product using machine learning. If you 
choose that option but don™t have enough data, you can 
overcome the problem by acquiring external data or by 
using simpler models.
Unlabeled data
 Pitfalls: 
A common problem when implementing AI is data 
that™s not classi˜ed by humans or machines, which leaves 
you unable to train the system (in the case of a supervised 
algorithm). For instance, if you wanted to predict fraud, but 
the historical fraudulent cases weren™t labelled, it would be 
impossible for the algorithm to map input to outputs.
 Recommendation: 
In this case, de˜ne what data you™ll 
need to run a sound model. This data will then need to
 be labeledŠwhich can be expensiveŠor you can use 
algorithms to accomplish this task. It™s a more advanced 
technique, but you can use reinforcement learning or 
semi-supervised models. Your data scientist might know 
which approach is best.
Explainable results
 Pitfalls: 
In many cases, the business wants and needs to 
know why speci˜c outcomes occur. This is in line with one 
of IBMs principles for ethical use of AI is: AI systems must 
be transparent and explainable. Depending on what kind 
of algorithm is used, an AI can™t show exactly which 
variables brought it to a given conclusion. We call these 
black-box algorithms. While they sometimes may perform 
better, they don™t give a lot of explanation. For example, 
you might have an algorithm that de˜nes whether an 
applicant gets a loan. According to European law in some 
countries, if you deny the applicant, you need to explain 
why you did so.
 Recommendation: 
There are several new algorithms that 
help explain what happens in the black-box models such 
 as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic (LIME).
10 But this doesn™t solve the problem in all cases. You should therefore 
de˜ne what you™re going to use the model for. If the model 
needs to explain precisely why it came to a certain conclusion, 
your data scientists should consider other models that provide 
the speci˜c information required. Ethics and AI should go 
hand-in-hand.

Summary
AI has the potential to bring a lot of value to your company 
if thought through and implemented properly. The authors 
of this paper hope we™ve made it clear how you can achieve 
this goal. We™ve discussed what AI is what it can do for your 
organization, how it should be implemented and what pitfalls 
you should avoid once you™ve decided to implement AI. 
To sum up this paper™s key points:
AI not something of the future, it is real today, and it fuels 
the fourth Industrial Revolution:
 As you will see later in this 
paper, there are many cases where AI is being successfully 
implemented and driving competitive advantage. Companies 
such as IBM, Nvidia, Twitter, Delta Airlines, Walmart, Netflix, 
Spotify and Kreditech show that their data-driven approach 
produces extremely valuable business models. But for many 
companies, failing to implement a data-driven strategy can 
lead to lost market share. 
Properly implementing AI requires careful evaluation and 
planning: You need to evaluate how AI can help solve your 
problems, where your company is right now in terms of 
capabilities and what needs to be done before you can 
properly implement AI to address the problems you want 
to solve or the opportunities you want to take. 
There is no one magic algorithm that can solve all your 
problems: 
Before implementing AI, you should focus on 
the problems you have and how AI can help you solve 
them. Next, you need to check whether the data you need 
to solve your problems is available. Often a hybrid between 
algorithms can be the right ˜t, depending on the problems 
you want to solve. 
Supervised learning provides the most economic value: 
Supervised learning is currently the most applied form of 
learning and provides the most value for a wide variety of 
applications. When beginning to implement AI in your 
enterprise, you™ll likely be working with supervised learning.
In the next section of this paper, we™ll talk about how IBM 
can play a role in implementing AI within your organization. 
IBM not only has many years of experience with these types 
of projects but has also been a pioneer in the AI arena. Based 
on its experience and knowledge, IBM can help companies of 
all sizes implement AI solutions.

THRIVEScale upThe ﬁThinkﬂ phase is a process dedicated to thinking, 
experimenting, and proving, with the end user at the heart
 of your innovation. We start with ideas and get to working 

concepts fast, incorporating feedback in real time.
IBM helps you get prepared ˜rst, in a fast, pressure-cooker 
environment. This helps you to kickstart your AI journey. 

IBM works with you to deliver an assessment of your 

current AI capabilities. 
In assessing your current AI capabilities, IBM looks at 

many different aspects, some of which are:
 ŠSystems: What does your innovation system look like?
 ŠPeople: How skilled is your staff in AI?
 ŠOrganization: How do you position AI expertise in 
 
your organization?
 ŠCulture: Do you operate in an agile fashion?
 ŠData: How readily available is your data?
 ŠTechnology: Does your current architecture enable AI?
IBM works with you to de˜ne your AI Ambition as a high-

level AI strategic direction by looking at ﬁbig ideasﬂ and 

by reflecting on persona™s and their user stories. A persona 
can be a marketing manager or a product developer. This 
ambition is translated into a roadmap and a high-level 

business case. IBM also supports you to select the most 

favorable operating model to move forward.
Once you are prepared for your garage, IBM uses design 
thinking to identify and de˜ne use cases. All use cases are 

conceived based on the notion of creating business value. 

In IBM™s experience, design thinking is the most effective 

way. This so-called ﬁdemand generationﬂ for the garage 
should be on-going, creating the backlog and setting the 
capacity planning for the garage.

IBM Services
     17Once the first use cases have been agreed, the garage 
provides the playground for deep technology, accommodating 

enterprise-scale ways of workingŠsuch as design thinking, 

agile, DevOps and lean IT. Innovation starts with a Proof 

of Value (POV): evaluating the business and technical 
feasibility of the use case in a time-boxed agile manner. 
Agile development is at the core of what IBM does in the 

garage. The goal is to succeed or fail quickly, with speed 
 to scale. Flexibility and speed are key! A successful POV will 

move into a pilot implementation. The IBM Garage leverages 

IBM™s extensive asset library to more ef˜ciently validate use 

cases and accelerate transformative change. 
Organizations should be prepared to step out of their comfort 
zones and think differently. Thinking in a data-driven and AI 
approach requires a shift in the way we see. It takes some 
effort to change our ways of thinking. This is where digital 

change management plays a role. You also need to consider 

the buildup of AI capabilities in your organization. IBM 

offers various forms of training and enablement ranging 

from Hackathons, planned learning universities for 

upskilling and an AI learning academy.
In the ﬁTransformﬂ phase, IBM collaborates with experts, 

data and emerging technologies, using accelerators to 

build minimum, viable products into production and realize 

business outcomes and customer adoption within weeks.
The third and last phase is the factory ﬁThriveﬂ phase, which is 
designed to rapidly scale solutions while establishing methods 

and new ways of working across your enterprise that can last 

a lifetime. The thrive phase works as a managed service to 
embed and maintain data and AI solutions at scale. Using a 
factory-like approach, you put into production something you 

want to be consistent in design and quality, and that doesn™t 

require innovation in execution. IBM focuses on successful 

delivery of projects aligned to the roadmap and AI platform 

technology and helps ensure a clearly de˜ned governance. 
Using this method, IBM has been successful many times 
and wants to keep improving the method with each project 

delivered. IBM is one of the frontrunners of AI and AI 
implementation, and thrives on applying its knowledge and 
experience to help improve the world.

AppendixDifferent types of learning
Learning.
 which is one of the fundamentals of arti˜cial 
intelligence and machine learning, is when the algorithm 
improves itself by looking at the data provided. There are two 
elements involved: knowledge and feedback. Knowledge 
provides information that™s already in the data, and the 
algorithm can learn from feedback through interactions with 
the user. This happens when a user gives the model feedback 
about correct or falsely predicted outcomes. There are four 
types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, 
reinforcement and transfer. Currently the most often used 
type is supervised learning, and thus we can say that the 
most economical value is created within this category.

**End Page**
IBM Services
     19Supervised learning
 is a learning method that maps an input 
to an output using human data and feedback to improve. A 
data set is provided with associated correct labels to the 
data. An example would be pictures of animals in which all 
pictures were correctly labelled as the animal in the pictures. 
Supervised learning trains based on historical data and 
builds rules that can be applied to predict future problems. 
The better the data set, the better the output. 
You may use this type of learning when you want to classify 
or predict outcomes. With regression, you are predicting a 
continuous value (ﬁHow much will the stock price be?ﬂ). 
With classifying, you are assigning a label to an input (ﬁIs 
this picture a man or a woman?ﬂ). Other examples would 
be using speech recognition to examine the sentiments of 
people calling your customer service center, or image 
recognition to define products in a warehouse so they 
could be properly sorted.
Unsupervised learning 
occurs when the algorithm is not 
given a speci˜c ﬁwrongﬂ or ﬁrightﬂ outcome. Instead, the 
algorithm is given unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning 
is often used when you want to classify data but don™t know 
how to do so. For example, you™d likely use unsupervised 
learning if you had a set of customer data and you didn™t 
know what kind of classes they would ˜t in. An unsupervised 
learning algorithm can find natural groupings of similar 
customers in a database and the user can then describe 
 and label them.Reinforcement learning
 is a class in and of itself; it is not 
given a speci˜c goal, but rather learns from trial and error. 
The main concept is that instead of a speci˜c action being 
labelled, there is a sequence of actions that is associated 
with a reward. If we take a maze as an example, the 
algorithm will be rewarded when it comes closer to its goal 
and be penalized every time it gets stuck or moves away 
from the completion. A recent example of reinforcement 
learning is AlphaGo, where Google trained a deep 
reinforcement learning network with many examples of 
the game Go, eventually making its performance superior 
to that of even the best human. This trick is not new, since 
it was used in TD-Gammon in 1992, created by Gerald 
Tesauro at IBM. TD-Gammon was a backgammon-playing 
program that reached the performance of the best human 
players at the time.
Reinforcement learning is not currently widely used, but it 
does have high potential when developed more extensively. 
You would need a lot of data (which is not always the case 
and takes time to process) to be able to make reinforcement 
learning work.
Transfer learning 
is when your algorithm learns to solve 
one problem, takes information from this problem and then 
solves a new problem with that information. This currently 
happens a lot with image recognition. Pre-trained neural 
networks are used to solve new problems.
