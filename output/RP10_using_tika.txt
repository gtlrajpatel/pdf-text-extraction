Series on Robotics and Autonomous 
Systems (RAS). This is one of the core 
activities of UK-RAS Network, funded by 
the Engineering and Physical Sciences 
Research Council (EPSRC). By bringing 
together academic centres of excellence, 
industry, government, funding bodies and 
charities, the Network provides academic 
leadership, expands collaboration with 
industry while integrating and coordinating 
activities at EPSRC funded RAS capital 
facilities, Centres for Doctoral Training and 
partner universities.

The recent successes of AI have captured 
the wildest imagination of both the scientific 
communities and the general public. 
Robotics and AI amplify human potentials, 
increase productivity and are moving from 
simple reasoning towards human-like 

cognitive abilities. Current AI technologies 
are used in a set area of applications, 
ranging from healthcare, manufacturing, 
transport, energy, to financial services, 
banking, advertising, management 
consulting and government agencies. The 
global AI market is around 260 billion USD 
in 2016 and it is estimated to exceed 3 
trillion by 2024. To understand the impact 
of AI, it is important to draw lessons from 
it's past successes and failures and this 
white paper provides a comprehensive 
explanation of the evolution of AI, its current 
status and future directions.

The UK-RAS white papers are intended to 
serve as a basis for discussing the future 
technological roadmaps, engaging the 
wider community and stakeholders, as well 
as policy makers, in assessing the potential 
social, economic and ethical/legal impact 

of RAS. It is our plan to provide annual 
updates for these white papers so your 
feedback is essential - whether it is to point 
out inadvertent omissions of specific areas 
of development that need to covered, or to 
suggest major future trends that deserve 
further debate and in-depth analysis. 

Please direct all your feedback to white-
paper@ukras.org. We look forward to 
hearing from you!

Artificial Intelligence and Robotics //

In 2016, Artificial Intelligence (AI) celebrated 
its 60th anniversary of the Dartmouth 
Workshop, which marked the beginning 
of AI being recognised as an academic 
discipline. One year on, the pace of AI has 
captured the wildest imagination of both the 
scientific community and the general public. 

The term AI now encompasses the whole 
conceptualisation of a machine that is 
intelligent in terms of both operational and 
social consequences. With the prediction 
of the AI market to reach 3 trillion by 2024, 
both industry and government funding 
bodies are investing heavily in AI and 
robotics. As the availability of information 
around us grows, humans will rely more 
and more on AI systems to live, to work, 
and to entertain. Given increased accuracy 
and sophistication of AI systems, they will 
be used in an increasingly diverse range of 
sectors including finance, pharmaceuticals, 
energy, manufacturing, education, transport 
and public services. It has been predicted 
that the next stage of AI is the era of 
augmented intelligence. Ubiquitous sensing 
systems and wearable technologies are 
driving towards intelligent embedded 

systems that will form a natural extension of 
human beings and our physical abilities. Will 
AI trigger a transformation leading to super-
intelligence that would surpass all human 
intelligence?

This white paper explains the origin of AI, 
its evolution in the last 60 years, as well 
as related subfields including machine 
learning, computer vision and the rise of 
deep learning. It provides a rational view 
of the different seasons of AI and how to 
learn from these ‘boom-and-bust’ cycles 
to ensure the current progresses are 
sustainable and here to stay. Along with 
the unprecedented enthusiasm of AI, there 
are also fears about the impact of the 
technology on our society. A clear strategy 
is required to consider the associated 
ethical and legal challenges to ensure that 
society as a whole will benefit from the 
evolution of AI and its potential negative 
impact is mitigated from early on. To this 
end, the paper outlines the ethical and legal 
issues of AI, which encompass privacy, 
jobs, legal responsibility, civil rights, and 
wrongful use of AI for military purposes. 
The paper concludes by providing a set 

of recommendations to the research 
community, industry, government agencies 
and policy makers. 

To sustain the current progress of AI, it is 
important to understand what is science 
fiction and what is practical reality. A 
rational and harmonic interaction is required 
between application specific projects 
and visionary research ideas. Neither the 
unrealistic enthusiasm nor the unjustified 
fears of AI should hinder its progress. 
They should be used to motivate the 
development of a systematic framework 
on which the future of AI will flourish. 
With sustained funding and responsible 
investment, AI is set to transform the 
future of our society - our life, our living 
environment and our economy.

1. INTRODUCTION

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a commonly employed appellation 
to refer to the field of science aimed at providing machines 
with the capacity of performing functions such as logic, 
reasoning, planning, learning, and perception. Despite the 
reference to “machines” in this definition, the latter could 
be applied to “any type of living intelligence”. Likewise, the 
meaning of intelligence, as it is found in primates and other 
exceptional animals for example, it can be extended to 
include an interleaved set of capacities, including creativity, 
emotional knowledge, and self-awareness.

The term AI was closely associated with the field of 
“symbolic AI”, which was popular until the end of the 1980s. 
In order to overcome some of the limitations of symbolic AI, 
subsymbolic methodologies such as neural networks, fuzzy 
systems, evolutionary computation and other computational 
models started gaining popularity, leading to the term 
“computational intelligence” emerging as a subfield of AI.

Nowadays, the term AI encompasses the whole 
conceptualisation of a machine that is intelligent in terms 
of both operational and social consequences. A practical 
definition used is one proposed by Russell and Norvig: 
“Artificial Intelligence is the study of human intelligence 
and actions replicated artificially, such that the resultant 
bears to its design a reasonable level of rationality” [1]. This 
definition can be further refined by stipulating that the level 
of rationality may even supersede humans, for specific and 
well-defined tasks. 

Current AI technologies are used in online advertising, 
driving, aviation, medicine and personal assistance image 
recognition. The recent success of AI has captured the 
imagination of both the scientific community and the public. 
An example of this is vehicles equipped with an automatic 
steering system, also known as autonomous cars. Each 
vehicle is equipped with a series of lidar sensors and 
cameras which enable recognition of its three-dimensional 
environment and provides the ability to make intelligent 

decisions on maneuvers in variable, real-traffic road 
conditions. Another example is the Alpha-Go, developed by 
Google Deepmind, to play the board game Go. Last year, 
Alpha-Go defeated the Korean grandmaster Lee Sedol, 
becoming the first machine to beat a professional player and 
recently it went on to win against the current world number 
one, Ke Jie, in China. The number of possible games in Go 
is estimated to be 10761 and given the extreme complexity 
of the game, most AI researchers believed it would be 
years before this could happen. This has led to both the 
excitement and fear in many that AI will surpass humans in 
all the fields it marches into. 

However, current AI technologies are limited to very specific 
applications. One limitation of AI, for example, is the lack of 
“common sense”; the ability to judge information beyond 
its acquired knowledge. A recent example is that of the AI 
robot Tay developed by Microsoft and designed for making 
conversations on social networks. It had to be disconnected 
shortly after its launch because it was not able to distinguish 
between positive and negative human interaction. AI is also 
limited in terms of emotional intelligence. AI can only detect 
basic human emotional states such as anger, joy, sadness, 
fear, pain, stress and neutrality. Emotional intelligence is one 
of the next frontiers of higher levels of personalisation. 

True and complete AI does not yet exist. At this level, AI will 
mimic human cognition to a point that it will enable the ability 
to dream, think, feel emotions and have own goals. Although 
there is no evidence yet this kind of true AI could exist before 
2050, nevertheless the computer science principles driving 
AI forward, are rapidly advancing and it is important to 
assess its impact, not only from a technological standpoint, 
but also from a social, ethical and legal perspective. 



Since 2000, a third renaissance of the 
connectionism paradigm arrived with the dawn 
of Big Data, propelled by the rapid adoption of 
the internet and mobile communication.

2. THE BIRTH AND BOOM OF AI

The birth of the computer took place when the first 
calculator machines were developed, from the mechanical 
calculator of Babbage, to the electromechanical calculator 
of Torres-Quevedo. The dawn of automata theory can 
be traced back to World War II with what was known as 
the “codebreakers”. The amount of operations required 
to decode the German trigrams of the Enigma machine, 
without knowing the rotor’s position, proved to be too 
challenging to be solved manually. The inclusion of automata 
theory in computing conceived the first logical machines to 
account for operations such as generating, codifying, storing 
and using information. Indeed, these four tasks are the basic 
operations of information processing performed by humans. 
The pioneering work by Ramón y Cajal marked the birth of 
neuroscience, although many neurological structures and 
stimulus responses were already known and studied before 
him. For the first time in history the concept of “neuron” 
was proposed. McClulloch and Pitts further developed a 
connection between automata theory and neuroscience, 
proposing the first artificial neuron which, years later, gave 
rise to the first computational intelligence algorithm, namely 
“the perceptron”. This idea generated great interest among 
prominent scientists of the time, such as Von Neumann, 
who was the pioneer of modern computers and set the 
foundation for the connectionism movement. 

1956 – 
when the term AI was first coined.
 
The Dartmouth Conference of 1956 was organized 
by Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and two senior 
scientists, Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester 
of IBM. At this conference, the expression 
“Artificial Intelligence” was first coined as the title 
of the field. The Dartmouth conference triggered a 
new era of discovery and unrestrained conquests 
of new knowledge. The computer programmes 
developed at the time are considered by most 
as simply "extraordinary"; computers solve 
algebraic problems, demonstrate theorems in 
geometry and learnt to speak English. At that 
time, many didn’t believe that such "intelligent" 
behavior was possible in machines. Researchers 
displayed a great deal of optimism both in private 
and in scientific publications. They predicted 
that a completely intelligent machine would be 
built in the next 20 years. Government agencies, 
such as the US Defence and Research Project 
Agency (DARPA), were investing heavily in this 
new area. It is worth mentioning, that some of 
the aforementioned scientists, as well as major 
laboratories of the time, such as Los Alamos 
(Nuevo Mexico, USA), had strong connections with 
the army and this link had a prominent influence, 
as the work at Bletchley Park (Milton Keynes, 
UK) had, over the course of WWII, as did political 
conflicts like the Cold War in AI innovation. 



Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  // 4

In 1971, DARPA funded a consortium of leading laboratories 
in the field of speech recognition. The project had the 
ambitious goal of creating a fully functional speech 
recognition system with a large vocabulary. In the middle 
of the 1970s, the field of AI endured fierce criticism and 
budgetary restrictions, as AI research development did not 
match the overwhelming expectations of researchers.. When 
promised results did not materialize, investment in AI eroded. 
Following disappointing results, DARPA withdrew funding in 
speech recognition and this, coupled with other events such 
as the failure of machine translation, the abandonment of 
connectionism and the Lighthill report, marked the first winter 
of AI [2]. During this period, connectionism stagnated for 
the next 10 years following a devastating critique by Marvin 
Minksy on perceptrons [3]. 

From 1980 until 1987, AI programmes, called “expert 
systems”, were adopted by companies and knowledge 
acquisition become the central focus of AI research. At the 
same time, the Japanese government launched a massive 
funding program on AI, with its fifth-generation computers 
initiative. Connectionism was also revived by the work of 
John Hopfield [4] and David Rumelhart [5].

AI researchers who had experienced the first backlash in 
1974, were sceptical about the reignited enthusiasms of 
expert systems and sadly their fears were well founded. 
The first sign of a changing tide was with the collapse of 
the AI computer hardware market in 1987. Apple and IBM 
desktops had gradually improved their speed and power 
and in 1987 they were more powerful than the best LISP 
machines on the market. Overnight however, the industry 

collapsed and billions of dollars were lost. The difficulty of 
updating and reprograming the expert systems, in addition 
to the high maintenance costs, led to the second AI winter. 
Investment in AI dropped and DARPA stopped its strategic 
computing initiative, claiming AI was no longer the “latest 
mode”. Japan also stopped funding its fifth-generation 
computer program as the proposed goals were not 
achieved.

In the 1990s, the new concept of “intelligent agent” emerged 
[6]. An agent is a system that perceives its environment 
and undertakes actions that maximize its chances of being 
successful. The concept of agents conveys, for the first 
time, the idea of intelligent units working collaboratively with 
a common objective. This new paradigm was intended to 
mimic how humans work collectively in groups, organizations 
and/or societies. Intelligent agents proved to be a more 
polyvalent concept of intelligence. In the late 1990s, fields 
such as statistical learning from several perspectives 
including probabilistic, frequentist and possibilistic (fuzzy 
logic) approaches, were linked to AI to deal with the 
uncertainty of decisions. This brought a new wave of 
successful applications for AI, beyond what expert  
systems had achieved during the 1980s. These new ways



5 // Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

of reasoning were more suited to cope with the uncertainty 
of intelligent agent states and perceptions and had its major 
impact in the field of control. During this time, high-speed 
trains controlled by fuzzy logic, were developed [7] as were 
many other industrial applications (e.g. factory valves, gas 
and petrol tanks surveillance, automatic gear transmission 
systems and reactor control in power plants) as well as 
household appliances with advanced levels of intelligence 
(e.g. air-conditioners, heating systems, cookers and vacuum-
cleaners). These were different to the expert systems in 
1980s; the modelling of the inference system for the task, 
achieved through learning, gave rise to the field of Machine 
Learning. Nevertheless, although machine reasoning 
exhibited good performance, there was still an engineering 
requirement to digest the input space into a new source, so 

that intelligence could reason more effectively. Since 2000, 
a third renaissance of the connectionism paradigm arrived 
with the dawn of Big Data, propelled by the rapid adoption 
of the Internet and mobile communication. Neural networks 
were once more considered, particularly in the role they 
played in enhancing perceptual intelligence and eliminating 
the necessity of feature engineering. Great advances were 
also made in computer vision, improving visual perception, 
increasing the capabilities of intelligent agents and robots 
in performing more complex tasks, combined with visual 
pattern recognition. All these paved the way to new AI 
challenges such as, speech recognition, natural language 
processing, and self-driving cars. A timeline of key highlights 
in the history of AI is shown in Figure 1.

so-called ”winters” of AI.

Weak and Strong AI
 
When defining the capacity of AI, this is frequently 
categorised in terms of weak or strong AI. 
Weak AI (narrow AI) is one intended to reproduce an 
observed behaviour as accurately as possible. It can 
carry out a task for which they have been precision-
trained. Such AI systems can become extremely efficient 
in their own field but lack generalisational ability. Most 
existing intelligent systems that use machine learning, 
pattern recognition, data mining or natural language 
processing are examples of weak AI. Intelligent systems, 
powered with weak AI include recommender systems, 
spam filters, self-driving cars, and industrial robots.
Strong AI is usually described as an intelligent system 
endowed with real consciousness and is able to think  

 
 
and reason in the same way as a human being. A 
strong AI can, not only assimilate information like a 
weak AI, but also modify its own functioning, i.e. is able 
to autonomously reprogram the AI to perform general 
intelligent tasks. These processes are regulated by 
human-like cognitive abilities including consciousness, 
sentience, sapience and self-awareness. Efforts intending 
to generate a strong AI have focused on whole brain 
simulations, however this approach has received 
criticism, as intelligence cannot be simply explained as a 
biological process emanating from a single organ but is a 
complex coalescence of effects and interactions between 
the intelligent being and its environment, encompassing a 
series of diverse ways via interlinked biological process.

7 // Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

Given the exponential rise of interest in AI, experts have 
called for major studies on the impact of AI on our society, 
not only in technological but also in legal, ethical and socio-
economic areas. This response also includes the speculation 
that autonomous super artificial intelligence may one day 
supersede the cognitive capabilities of humans. This future 
scenario is usually known in AI forums as the “AI singularity” 
[8]. This is commonly defined as the ability of machines to 
build better machines by themselves. This futuristic scenario 
has been questioned and is received with scepticism by 
many experts. Today’s AI researchers are more focused on 
developing systems that are very good at tasks in a narrow 
range of applications. This focus is at odds with the idea of 
the pursuit of a super generic AI system that could mimic all 
different cognitive abilities related to human intelligence such 
as self-awareness and emotional knowledge. In addition 
to this debate, about AI development and the status of our 
hegemony as the most intelligent species on the planet, 
further societal concerns have been raised. For example, the 
AI100 (One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) a 
committee led by Stanford University, defined 18 topics of 
importance for AI [9]. Although these are not exhaustive nor 
definitive, it sets forth the range of topics that need to be 
studied, for the potential impact of AI and stresses that there 
are a number of concerns to be addressed. Many similar 
assessments have been performed and they each outline 
similar concerns related to the wider adoption of  
AI technology.

The 18 topics covered by the AI100  

Technical trends and surprises: This topic aims at 
forecasting the future advances and competencies of AI 
technologies in the near future. Observatories of the trend 
and impact of AI should be created, helping to plan the 
setting of AI in specific sectors, and preparing the necessary 
regulation to smooth its introduction.

Key opportunities for AI: How advances in AI can help to 
transform the quality of societal services such as health, 
education, management and government, covering not just 
the economic benefits but also the social advantages and 
impact.

Delays with translating AI advances into real-world values: 
The pace of translating AI into real world applications is 
currently driven by potential economic prospects [10]. It is 
necessary to take measures to foster a rapid translation of 
those potential applications of AI that can improve or solve a 
critical need of our society, such as those that can save lives 
or greatly improve the organisation of social services, even 
though their economic exploitation is not yet assured.

Privacy and machine intelligence: Personal data and 
privacy is a major issue to consider and it is important 
to envisage and prepare the regulatory, legal and policy 
frameworks related to the sharing of personal data in 
developing AI systems. 

Democracy and freedom: In addition to privacy, ethical 
questions with respect to the stealth use of AI for 
unscrupulous applications must be considered. The use  
of AI should not be at the expense of limiting or influencing 
the democracy and the freedom of people. 

Law: This considers the implications of relevant laws and 
regulations. First, to identify which aspects of AI require 
legal assessment and what actions should be undertaken 
to ensure law enforcement for AI services. It should also 
provide frameworks and guidelines about how to adhere to 
the approved laws and policies.

Ethics: By the time AI is deployed into real world 
applications there are ethical concerns referring to their 
interaction with the world. What uses of AI should be 
considered unethical? How should this be disclosed? 

3. QUESTIONING THE IMPACT OF AI



Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  // 8

Economics: The economic implications of AI on jobs 
should be monitored and forecasted such that policies can 
be implemented to direct our future generation into jobs 
that will not be soon overtaken by machines. The use of 
sophisticated AI in the financial markets could potentially 
cause volatilities and it is necessary to assess the influence 
AI systems may have on financial markets.

AI and warfare: AI has been employed for military 
applications for more than a decade. Robot snipers and 
turrets have been developed for military purposes [11]. 
Intelligent weapons have increasing levels of autonomy 
and there is a need for developing new conventions and 
international agreements to define a set of secure boundaries 
of the use of AI in weaponry and warfare.

Criminal uses of AI: Implementations of AI into malware 
are becoming more sophisticated thus the chances of 
stealing personal information from infected devices are 
getting higher. Malware can be more difficult to detect as 
evasion techniques by computer viruses and worms may 
leverage highly sophisticated AI techniques [12, 13]. Another 
example is the use of drones and their potential to fall into 
the hands of terrorists the consequence of which  would be 
devastating. 

Collaboration with machines: Humans and robots need 
to work together and it is pertinent to envisage in which 
scenarios collaboration is critical and how to perform this 
collaboration safely. Accidents by robots working side by 
side with people had happened before [14] and robotic and 
autonomous systems development should focus on not only 
enhanced task precision but in also being able to understand 
the environment and human intention.

AI and human cognition: AI has the potential for enhancing 
human cognitive abilities. Some relevant research disciplines 
with this objective are sensor informatics and human-
computer interfaces. Apart from applications to rehabilitation 
and assisted living, they are also used in surgery [15] and 
air traffic control [16]. Cortical implants are increasingly used 
for controlling prosthesis, our memory and reasoning are 
increasingly relying on machines and the associated health, 
safety and ethical impacts must be addressed.

Safety and Autonomy: For the safe operation of intelligent, 
autonomous systems, formal verification tools should be 
developed to assess their safety operation. Validation can 
be focused on the reasoning process and verifying whether 
the knowledge base of an intelligent system is correct [17] 
and also making sure that the formulation of the intelligent 
behaviour will be within safety boundaries [18].

Loss of control of AI systems: The potential of AI being 
independent from human control is a major concern. Studies 
should be promoted to address this concern both from the 
technological standpoint and the relevant framework for 
governing the responsible development of AI. 

Psychology of people and smart machines: More research 
should be undertaken to obtain detailed knowledge about 
the opinions and concerns people have, in the wider usage 
of smart machines in societies. Additionally, in the design of 
intelligent systems, understanding people’s preferences is 
important for improving their acceptability [19, 20].

Communication, understanding and outreach: 
Communication and educational strategies must be 
developed to embrace AI technologies in our society. 
These strategies must be formulated in ways that are 
understandable and accessible by non-experts and the 
general public. 

Neuroscience and AI: Neuroscience and AI can develop 
together. Neuroscience plays an important role for guiding 
research in AI and with new advances in high performance 
computing, there are also new opportunities to study the 
brain through computational models and simulations in order 
to investigate new hypotheses [21].

AI and philosophy of mind: When AI can experience a level 
of consciousness and self-awareness, there will be a need 
to understand the inner world of the psychology of machines 
and their subjectivity of consciousness.



9 // Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

The evolution of AI to date, has endured several cycles of 
optimism (springs) and pessimism or negativism (winters): 

•  Birth of AI (1952-1956): Before the term AI was coined, 
there were already advances in cybernetics and neural 
networks, which started to attract the attention of both 
the scientific communities and the public. The Dartmouth 
Conference (1956) was the result of this increasing 
interest and gave rise to the following golden years of AI 
with high levels of optimism in the field. 

•  First spring (1956-1974): Computers of the time could 
solve algebra and geometric problems, as well as speak 
English. Advances were qualified as “impressive” and 
there was a general atmosphere of optimism in the field. 
Researchers in the area estimated that a fully intelligent 
machine would be built in the following 20 years. 

•  First winter (1974-1980): The winter started when 
the public and media questioned the promises of AI. 
Researchers were caught in a spiral of exaggerated 
claims and forecasts but the limitations the technology 
posed at the time were inviolable. An abrupt ending of 
funding by major agencies such as DARPA, the National 
Research Council and the British Government, led to the 
first winter of AI. 

•  Second Spring (1980-1987): Expert systems were 
developed to solve problems of a specific domain by 
using logical rules derived from experts. There was 
also a revival of connectionism and neural networks for 
character or speech recognition. This period is known as 
the second spring of AI. 

•  Second winter (1987-1993): Specialised machines for 
running expert systems were displaced by new desktop 
computers. Consequently some companies, that 
produced expert systems, went into bankruptcy. This led 
to a new wave of pessimism ending the funding programs 
initiated during the previous spring. 

•  In the background (1997-2000): From 1997 to 2000, 
the field of AI was progressing behind the scenes, as 
no further multi-million programs were announced. 
Despite the lack of major funding the area continued to 
progress, as increased computer power and resources 
were developed. New applications in specific areas were 
developed and the concept of “machine learning” started 
to become the cornerstone of AI.

•  Third spring (2000-Present): Since 2000, with the 
success of the Internet and web, the Big Data revolution 
started to take off along with newly emerged areas such 
as Deep Learning. This new period is known as the third 
spring of AI and for time being, it looks like it is here to 
stay. Some have even started to predict the imminent 
arrival of singularity - an intelligence explosion resulting in 
a powerful super-intelligence that will eventually surpass 
human intelligence. Is this possible?

 
4.2 INFLUENCE OF FUNDING    
Government organisations and the public sector are 
investing millions to boost artificial intelligence research.  
For example, the National Research Foundation of 
Singapore is investing $150 million into a new national 
programme in AI. In the UK alone, £270 million is being 
invested from 2017 to 2018 to boost science, research 
and innovation, via the Government’s new industrial 
strategy and a further funding of £4.7 billion is planned 
by 2021 [22]. This timely investment will put UK in the 
technological lead among the best in the world and ensure 
that UK technological innovations can compete. Recent AI 
developments have triggered major investment across all 
sectors including financial services, banking, marketing and 
advertising, in hospitals and government administration. 
In fact software and information technology services have 
more than a 30% share in all AI investments worldwide as of 
2016, whereas Internet and telecommunication companies 
follow with 9% and 4%, respectively [23].

It is also important to note that the funding in AI safety, 
ethics and strategy/policy has almost doubled in the last 
three years [24]. Apart from non-profit organisations, 
such as the Future of Life Institute (FLI) and the Machine 
Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), other centres, such 
as the Centre for Human-Compatible AI and Centre for the 
Future of Intelligence, have emerged and they, along with key 
technological firms, invested a total of $6.6 million in 2016. 

 
4.3 PUBLICATION VERSUS PATENTING 
In terms of international output in publications and patents, 
there has been a shift of predominant countries influencing 
the field of AI. In 1995 USA and Japan were the two leading 
countries in the field of AI patents but this has now shifted to 

Asia, with China becoming a major player. Since 2010 China 
and USA have led the way in both scientific publications and 
in the filing of patents. Other emerging economies, such as 
India and Brazil, are also rapidly rising.

Recently, there has been a shift relocation of many academic 
professionals in AI to the industrial sector. The world's largest 
technology companies have hired several entire research 
teams previously in universities. These corporations have 
opted for the publication of pre-prints (ArXiv1 or viXra2) and 
other non-citable documents, instead of using conventional 
academic methods of peer-review. This has become an 
increasing trend. The reason for this is that it allows the 
prioritisation of claim imprinting without the delay of a peer-
review process.

5. FINANCIAL IMPACT OF AI
It has been well recognised that AI amplifies human 
potential as well as productivity and this is reflected in 
the rapid increase of investment across many companies 
and organisations. These include sectors in healthcare, 
manufacturing, transport, energy, banking, financial services, 
management consulting, government administration and 
marketing/advertising. The revenues of the AI market 
worldwide, were around 260 billion US dollars in 2016 and 
this is estimated to exceed $3,060 billion by 2024 [23].  
This has had a direct effect on robotic applications, including 
exoskeletons, rehabilitation, surgical robots and personal 
care-bots. The economic impact of the next 10 years is 
estimated to be between $1.49 and $2.95 trillion. These 
estimates are based on benchmarks that take into account 
similar technological achievements such as broadband, 
mobile phones and industrial robots [28]. The investment 
from the private sector and venture capital is a measure of 
the market potential of the underlying technology. In 2016, a 
third of the shares from software and information technology 

have been invested in AI, whereas in 2015, 1.16 billion US 
dollars were invested in start-up companies worldwide, a 
10-fold increase since 2009. 

Major technological firms are investing into applications 
for speech recognition, natural language processing and 
computer vision. A significant leap in the performance of 
machine learning algorithms resulting from deep learning, 
exploited the improved hardware and sensor technology 
to train artificial networks with large amounts of information 
derived from ‘big data’ [31, 32]. Current state-of-the-art AI 
allows for the automation of various processes and new 
applications are emerging with the potential to change the 
entire workings of the business world. As a result, there is 
huge potential for economic growth, which is demonstrated 
in the fact that between 2014 and 2015 alone, Google, 
Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, IBM, Yahoo, Facebook, and 
Twitter, made at least 26 acquisitions of start-ups and 
companies developing AI technology, totalling over $5 billion 
in cost.

In 2014, Google acquired DeepMind, a London-based 
start-up company specialising in deep learning, for more 
than $500M and set a record of company investment of 
AI research to academic standard. In fact, DeepMind has 
produced over 140 journal and conference papers and 
has had four articles published in Nature since 2012. One 
of the achievements of DeepMind was in developing AI 
technology able to create general-purpose software agents 
that adjust their actions based only on a cumulative reward. 
This reinforcement learning approach exceeds human level 
performance in many aspects and has been demonstrated 
with the defeat of the world Go game champion; marking a 
historical landmark in AI progress. 

IBM has developed a supercomputer platform, Watson, 
which has the capability to perform text mining and extract 
complex analytics from large volumes of unstructured 
data. To demonstrate its abilities, IBM Watson, in 2011, 
beat two top players on ‘Jeopardy!’, a popular quiz show, 
that requires participants to guess questions from specific 

answers. Although, information retrieval is trivial for computer 
systems, comprehension of natural language is still a 
challenge. This achievement has had a significant impact 
on the performance of web searches and the overall ability 
of AI systems to interact with humans. In 2015, IBM bought 
AlchemyAPI to incorporate its text and image analysis 
capabilities in the cognitive computing platform of the IBM 
Watson. The system has already been used to process legal 
documents and provide support to legal duties. Experts 
believe that these capabilities can transform current health 
care systems and medical research.  

Research in top AI firms is centred on the development 
of systems that are able to reliably interact with people. 
Interaction takes more natural forms through real-time 
speech recognition and translation capabilities. Robo-advisor 
applications are at the top of the AI market with a globally 
estimated 255 billion in US dollars by 2020 [23]. There are 
already several virtual assistants offered by major companies. 
For example, Apple offers Siri and Amazon Alexa, Microsoft 



Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  // 14

offers Cortana, and Google has the Google Assistant.  
In 2016, Apple Inc. purchased Emotient Inc., a start-up 
using artificial-intelligence technology to read people’s 
emotions by analyzing facial expressions. DeepMind created 
WaveNet, which is a generative model that mimics human 
voices. According to the company’s website, this sounds 
more natural than the best existing Text-to-Speech systems. 
Facebook is also considering machine-human interaction 
capabilities as a prerequisite to generalised AI. 

Recently, OpenAI, a non-profit organisation, has been 
funded as part of a strategic plan to mitigate the risks of 
monopolising strong AI. OpenAI has re-designed evolutional 
algorithms that can work together with deep neural networks 
to offer state-of-the-art performance. It is considered to 
rival DeepMind since it offers similar open-source machine 
learning libraries to TensorFlow, a deep learning library 
distributed by Google DeepMind. Nevertheless, the big 
difference between the technology developed at OpenAI 
and the other private tech companies, is that the created 
Intellectual Property is accessible by everyone. 

Although several companies and organisations, including 
DeepMind and OpenAI, envision the solution to the creation 
of intelligence and the so-called Strong AI, developing 
machines with self-sustained long-term goals is well 
beyond current technology. Furthermore, there is vigorous 
debate on whether or not we are going through an AI 
bubble, which encompasses the paradox that productivity 
growth in USA, during the last decade, has declined 
regardless of an explosion of technological progress and 
innovation. It is difficult to understand whether this reflects 
a statistical shortcoming or that current innovations are not 
transformative enough. This decline can be also attributed 
to the lack of consistent policy frameworks and security 
standards that can enable the application of AI in projects  
of significant impact.

For the first time, the UK government has singled 
out robotics and AI in its blueprint for a ‘modern’ 
industrial strategy. It brings some certainty in 
this uncertain time, demonstrating the UK’s drive 
to kick-start disruptive technologies that could 
transform our economy, with a clear vision for 
positioning the UK in the international landscape.



Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  // 18

AI is a diverse field of research and the following subfields 
are essential to its development. These include neural 
networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary computation, and 
probabilistic methods.

Neural networks build on the area of connectionism with 
the main purpose of mimicking the way the nervous system 
processes information. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and 
variants have allowed significant progress of AI to perform 
tasks relative to “perception”. When combined with the 
current multicore parallel computing hardware platforms, 
many neural layers can be stacked to provide a higher level 
of perceptual abstraction in learning its own set of features, 
thus removing the need for handcrafted features; a process 
known as deep learning [33]. Limitations of using deep 
layered ANN include 1) low interpretability of the resultant 
learned model, 2) large volumes of training data and 
considerable computational power are often required for the 
effective application of these neural models.

Deep learning is part of machine learning and is usually 
linked to deep neural networks that consist of a multi-
level learning of detail or representations of data. Through 
these different layers, information passes from low-level 
parameters to higher-level parameters. These different 
levels correspond to different levels of data abstraction, 
leading to learning and recognition. A number of deep 
learning architectures, such as deep neural networks, deep 
convolutional neural networks and deep belief networks, 
have been applied to fields such as computer vision, 
automatic speech recognition, and audio and music signal 
recognition and these have been shown to produce cutting-
edge results in various tasks.

Fuzzy logic focuses on the manipulation of information 
that is often imprecise. Most computational intelligence 
principles account for the fact that, whilst observations 
are always exact, our knowledge of the context, can often 
be incomplete or inaccurate as it is in many real-world 
situations. Fuzzy logic provides a framework in which to 
operate with data assuming a level of imprecision over a  
set of observations, as well as structural elements to 
enhance the interpretability of a learned model [34]. It does 
provide a framework for formalizing AI methods, as well as 
an accessible translation of AI models into electronic circuits. 
Nevertheless, fuzzy logic does not provide learning abilities 
per se, so it is often combined with other aspects such a 
neural networks, evolutionary computing or  
statistical learning.

Evolutionary computing relies on the principle of natural 
selection, or natural patterns of collective behaviour [35]. 
The two most relevant subfields include genetic algorithms 
and swarm intelligence. Its main impact on AI is on multi-
objective optimization, in which it can produce very robust 
results. The limitations of these models are like neural 
networks about interpretability and computing power.

Statistical Learning is aimed at AI employing a more 
classically statistical perspective, e.g., Bayesian modelling, 
adding the notion of prior knowledge to AI. These methods 
benefit from a wide set of well-proven techniques and 
operations inherited from the field of classical statistics, as 
well as a framework to create formal methods for AI. The 
main drawback is that, probabilistic approaches express 
their inference as a correspondence to a population [36]  
and the probability concept may not be always applicable, 
for instance, when vagueness or subjectivity need to be 
measured and addressed [37].

Ensemble learning and meta-algorithms is an area of AI 
that aims to create models that combine several weak base 
learners in order to increase accuracy, while reducing its bias 
and variance. For instance, ensembles can show a higher 
flexibility with respect to single model approaches on which 
some complex patterns can be modelled. Some well-known 
meta-algorithms for building ensembles are bagging and 
boosting. Ensembles can take advantage of significant 
computational resources to train many base classifiers 
therefore enhancing the ability to augment resolution of the 
pattern search - although this does not always assure the 
attainment of a higher accuracy. 

Logic-based artificial intelligence is an area of AI commonly 
used for task knowledge representation and inference. It can 
represent predicate descriptions, facts and semantics of a 
domain by means of formal logic, in structures known as 
logic programs. By means of inductive logic programming 
hypotheses can be derived over the known background.

Timeline of the main discoveries and seasons in AI: from perceptron to deep learning

19 // Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

The idea of creating an artificial machine is as old as the 
invention of the computer. Alan Turing in the early 1950s 
proposed the Turing test, designed to assess whether a 
machine could be defined as intelligent. Two of the main 
pioneers in this field are Pitts and McCulloch [38] who, in 
1943, developed a technique designed to mimic the way 
a neuron works. Inspired by this work, a few years later, 
Frank Rosenblatt [39] developed the first real precursor 
of the modern neural network, called Perceptron. This 
algorithm describes an automatic learning procedure that 
can discriminate linearly separable data. Rosenblatt was 
confident that the perceptron would lead to an AI system in 
the future. The introduction of perceptron, in 1958, signalled 
the beginning of the AI evolution. For almost 10 years 
afterwards, researchers used this approach to automatically 
learn how to discriminate data in many applications, until 
Papert and Minsky [3], demonstrated a few important 
limitations of Perceptron. This slowed down the fervour 
of AI progress and more specifically, they proved that the 
perceptron was not capable of learning simple functions, 
such as the exclusive-or XOR, no matter how long the 
network was trained.

Today, we know that the model implied by the perceptron is 
linear and the XOR function does not belong to this family, 
but at the time this was enough to stop the research behind 
neural nets and began the first AI winter. Much later in 1974, 
the idea of organizing the perceptron in layers and training 
them using the delta rule [40] shaped the creation of more 
complex neural nets. With the introduction of the Multilayer 
Neural Nets [41], researchers were confident that adding 
multiple hidden layers to the networks would produce deep 
architectures that further increase the complexity of the 
hypothesis that can be expressed. However, the hardware 
constraints that were present at that time, limited, for many 
years, the number of layers that could be used in practice. 
To overcome these hardware limitations different network 
configurations were proposed. For almost another decade, 
researchers focused on producing new efficient network 
architectures that are suitable for specific contexts. Notably, 
these developments included the Autoencoder [42] useful in 
extracting relevant features from data, the Belief nets used to 
model statistical variables, the Recurrent neural nets [43] and 
its variant Long Short Term Memory [44] used for processing 
sequence of data, and the Convolutional neural nets [45] 
used to process images. Despite these new AI solutions, the 
aforementioned hardware limitations were a big restriction 
during training.

Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  // 20

With recent hardware advances, such as the parallelization 
using GPU, the cloud computing and the multi-core 
processing finally led to the present stage of AI. In this 
stage, deep neural nets have made tremendous progress 
in terms of accuracy and they can now recognize complex 
images and perform voice translation in real time. However, 
researchers are still dealing with issues relating to the 
overfitting of the networks, since large datasets are often 
required and not always available. Furthermore, with the 
vanishing of the gradient, this leads to a widespread problem 
generated during the training of a network with many layers. 
For this reason, more sophisticated training procedures 
have recently been proposed. For example, in 2006, Hinton 
introduced the idea of unsupervised pretraining and Deep 
Belief Nets [46]. This approach has each pair of consecutive 
layers trained separately using an unsupervised model 
similar to the one used in the Restricted Boltzman Machine 
[47]; then the obtained parameters are frozen and a new 
pair of layers are trained and stacked on top of the previous 
ones. This procedure can be repeated many times leading 
to the development of a deeper architecture with respect 
to the traditional neural nets. Moreover, this unsupervised 
pre-training approach has led to increasing neural net papers 
when in 2014, for the first time, a neural model became 
state-of-the-art in the speech recognition. 

In 2010, a large database, known as Imagenet containing 
millions of labelled images was created and this was 
coupled with an annual challenge called Large Scale Visual 
Recognition Challenge. This competition requires teams of 
researchers to build AI systems and they receive a score 
based on how accurate their model is. In the first two years 
of the contest, the top models had an error rate of 28% 
and 26%. In 2012, Krizhevsky, Sutskever and Hinton [48] 
submitted a solution that had an error rate of just 16% and 
in 2015 the latest submitted models [49] were capable of 
beating the human experts with an overall error of 5%. One 
of the main components of this significant improvement, in 
such a short time, was due to the extensive use of graphics 
processing units (GPUs) for speeding up the training 
procedure, thus allowing the use of larger models which also 
meant a lower error rate in classification.

In the last 3 years researchers have also been working on 
training deep neural nets that are capable of beating human 
experts in different fields, similar to the solution used for 
AlphaGo [50] or DeepStack [51]and in 2017, they overtook 
human experts with 44000 played hands of poker.

1985:  
Boltzmann Machines

Boltzmann Machines represent a type of neural network modelled by using stochastic 
units with a specific distribution (for example Gaussian). Learning procedure involves 
several steps called Gibbs sampling, which gradually adjust the weights to minimize 
the reconstruction error. They are useful if it is required to model probabilistic 
relationships between variables. A variant of this machine is the Restricted Boltzmann 
Machines where the visible and hidden units are restricted to form a bipartite graph 
that allows implementation of more efficient training algorithms. 

1986:  
AutoEncoder

An Autoencoder is a neural network designed to extract features directly from the 
data. This network has the same number of input and output nodes and it is trained 
using an unsupervised approach to recreate the input vector rather than to assign a 
class label to it. Usually, the number of hidden units is smaller than the input/output 
layers, which achieve encoding of the data in a lower dimensional space and extract 
the most discriminative features.

1987:  
Convolutional neural network (CNN)

CNNs have been proposed to process efficiently imagery data. The name of these 
networks comes from the convolution operator that provides an easy way to perform 
complex operations using convolution filter. CNNs use locally connected neurons 
that represent data specific kernels. The main advantage of a CNN is that during 
back-propagation, the network has to adjust a number of parameters equal to a 
single instance of the kernel which drastically reduces the connections from the 
typical neural network. The concept of CNN is inspired by the neurobiological model 
of the visual cortex and can be briefly summarized as a sequence of convolution and 
subsampling of the image until high level features can be extracted.

1989:  
Recurrent neural nets (RNN)

RNN is a neural network that contains hidden units capable of analysing streams 
of data. Since RNN suffers from the vanishing gradient and exploding gradient 
problems, a variation called Long Short-Term Memory units (LSTMs) was proposed in 
1997 to solve this problem. Specifically, LSTM is particularly suitable for applications 
where there are very long time lags of unknown sizes between important events. 
RNN and LSTM share the same weights across all steps that greatly reduce the total 
number of parameters that the network needs to learn. RNNs have shown great 
successes in many Natural Language Processing tasks such as language modelling, 
bioinformatics, speech recognition and generating image description.

In 1965, Gordon Moore observed that the number 
of transistors, in a dense integrated circuit, doubles 
approximately every year. Ten years later, he revised his 
forecast, updating his prediction to the number doubling 
every two years. Moore's prediction has been accurate for 
several decades and has been used in the semiconductor 
industry to guide long-term planning. In 2015, Moore 
realised that the rate of progress in the hardware would 
reach saturation and the transistors would arrive at the limits 
of miniaturisation at the atomic level. Experts estimate that 
Moore’s law could end in 2025. Today, his prediction is  
still valid and the number of transistors is increasing  

even if, after 2005, the frequency and the power started to 
reduce, leading to a core scaling rather than a frequency 
improvement. Therefore, since 2005, we are no longer 
getting faster computers, but the hardware is designed in 
a multi-core manner. To take full advantage of this different 
hardware implementation, the software has to be written 
in a multi-threaded manner too. In future, experts believe 
that revolutionary technologies may help sustain Moore's 
law. One of the key challenges will be the design of gates in 
nanoscale transistors and the ability of controlling the current 
flow as, when the device dimension shrinks, the connection 
between transistors becomes more difficult.

23 // Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

Modern machines combine powerful multicore CPUs with 
dedicated hardware designed to solve parallel processing.  
GPU and FPGA are the most popular dedicated hardware 
commonly available in workstations  developing AI systems. 

A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a chip designed to 
accelerate the processing of multidimensional data such as an 
image. A GPU consists of thousands of smaller cores, intended 
to work independently on a subspace of the input data, that 
needs heavy computation. Repetitive functions that can be 
applied to different parts of the input, such as texture mapping, 
image rotation, translation and filtering, are performed at a much 
faster rate and more efficiently, through the use of the GPU.  
A GPU has dedicated memory and the data must be moved in 
and out in order to be processed.

FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is a reconfigurable 
digital logic containing an array of programmable logic blocks 
and a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnections. An FPGA 
is not a processor and therefore it cannot run a program 
stored in the memory. An FPGA is configured using a hardware 
description language (HDL) and unlike the traditional CPU, it is 
truly parallel. This means, that each independent processing 
task is assigned to a dedicated section of the chip and many 
parts of the same program can be performed in simultaneously. 
A typical FPGA may also have dedicated memory blocks, digital 
clock manager, IO banks and several other features, which vary 
across different models. While a GPU is designed to perform 
efficiently, with similar threads on different subsets of the input, 
an FPGA is designed to parallelize sequential serial processing 
of the same program.

9. ROBOTICS AND AI

Building on the advances made in mechatronics, electrical 
engineering and computing, robotics is developing 
increasingly sophisticated sensorimotor functions that 
give machines the ability to adapt to their ever-changing 
environment. Until now, the system of industrial production 
was organized around the machine; it is calibrated according 
to its environment and tolerated minimal variations. 
Today, it can be integrated more easily into an existing 
environment. The autonomy of a robot in an environment 
can be subdivided into perceiving, planning and execution 
(manipulating, navigating, collaborating). The main idea of 
converging AI and Robotics is to try to optimise its level of 
autonomy through learning. This level of intelligence can be 
measured as the capacity of predicting the future, either in 
planning a task, or in interacting (either by manipulating or 
navigating) with the world. Robots with intelligence have 
been attempted many times. Although creating a system 
exhibiting human-like intelligence remains elusive, robots that 
can perform specialized autonomous tasks, such as driving 
a vehicle [52], flying in natural and man-made environments 
[53], swimming [54], carrying boxes and material in different 
terrains [55], pick up objects [56] and put them down [57]  
do exist today. 

Another important application of AI in robotics is for the task 
of perception. Robots can sense the environment by means 
of integrated sensors or computer vision. In the last decade, 
computer systems have improved the quality of both sensing 

and vision. Perception is not only important for planning but 
also for creating an artificial sense of self-awareness in the 
robot. This permits supporting interactions with the robot 
with other entities in the same environment. This discipline 
is known as social robotics. It covers two broad domains: 
human-robot interactions (HCI) and cognitive robotics. 
The vision of HCI it to improve the robotic perception of 
humans such as in understanding activities [58], emotions 
[59], non-verbal communications [60] and in being able to 
navigate an environment along with humans [61]. The field 
of cognitive robotics focuses on providing robots with the 
autonomous capacity of learning and acquiring knowledge 
from sophisticated levels of perception based on imitation 
and experience. It aims at mimicking the human cognitive 
system, which regulates the process of acquiring knowledge 
and understanding, through experience and sensorisation 
[62]. In cognitive robotics, there are also models that 
incorporate motivation and curiosity to improve the quality 
and speed of knowledge acquisition through learning  
[63, 64]. 

AI has continued beating all records and overcoming many 
challenges that were unthinkable less than a decade ago. 
The combination of these advances will continue to reshape 
our understanding about robotic intelligence in many new 
domains. Figure 9 provides a timeline of the milestone in 
robotics and AI.

Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  // 28

Programming languages played a major role in the evolution 
of AI since the late 1950s and  several teams carried 
out important research projects in AI; e.g. automatic 
demonstration programs and game programs (Chess, 
Ladies) [65]. During these periods researchers found 
that one of the special requirements for AI is the ability 
to easily manipulate symbols and lists of symbols rather 
than processing numbers or strings of characters. Since 
the languages of the time did not offer such facilities, a 
researcher from MIT, John MacCarthy, developed, during 
1956-58, the definition of an ad-hoc language for logic 
programming, called LISP (LISt Processing language).  
Since then, several hundred derivative languages,  

so-called "Lisp dialects", have emerged (Scheme, Common 
Lisp, Clojure); Indeed, writing a LISP interpreter is not a hard 
task for a Lisp programmer (it involves only a few thousand 
instructions) compared to the development of a compiler 
for a classical language (which requires several tens of 
thousands of instructions). Because of its expressiveness 
and flexibility, LISP was very successful in the artificial 
intelligence community until the 1990s. 

Another important event at the beginning of AI was the 
creation of a language with the main purpose of expressing 
logic rules and axioms. Around 1972 a new language was 
created by Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel named 



29 // Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

Prolog (PROgramming in Logic). Their goal was to create  
a programming language where the expected logical  
rules of a solution can be defined and the compiler 
automatically transforms it into a sequence of instructions. 
Prolog is used in AI and in natural language processing. Its 
rules of syntax and its semantics are simple and considered 
accessible to non-programmers. One of the objectives was 
to provide a tool for linguistics that was compatible with 
computer science. 

In the 1990s, the machine languages with C / C ++ and 
Fortran gained popularity and eclipsed the use of LISP 
and Prolog. Greater emphasis was placed on creating 
functions and libraries for scientific computation on these 
platforms and were used for intensive data analysis tasks 
or artificial intelligence with early robots. In the middle of the 
1990s, the company Sun Microsystems, started a project 
to create a language that solved secutiry flaws, distributed 
programming and multi-threading of C++. In addition, they 
wanted a platform that could be ported to any type of device 
or platform. In 1995, they presented Java, which took the 
concept of object orientation much further than C++.  
Equally, one of the most important additions to Java was 
the Java VM (JVM) which enabled the capability of running 
the same code in any device regardless of their internal 
technology and without the need of pre-compiling for every 
platform. This added new advantages to the field of AI 
that were be introduced in devices such as cloud servers 
and embedded computers. Another important feature of 
Java was that it also offered one of the first frameworks, 
with specific tools for the internet, bringing the possibility 
of running applications in the form of java applets and 
javascripts (i.e. self-executing programs) without the need of 
installation. This had an enormous impact in the field of AI 
and a set the foundation in the fields of web 2.0/3.0 and the 
internet of things (IoT).

However, the development of AI using purely procedural 
languages was costly, time-consuming and error prone. 
Consequently, this turned the attention into other multi-
paradigm languages that could combine features from 
functional and procedural object-oriented languages.  
Python, although first published in 1991, started to gain 
popularity as an alternative to C/C++ with Python 2.2 by 
2001. The Python concept was to have a language that 
could be as powerful as C/C++ but also expressive and 
pragmatic for executing "scripts" like Shell Script. It was 
in 2008, with the publication of Python 3.0, which solved 
several initial flaws, when the language started to be 
considered a serious contender for C++, java and other 
scripting languages such as Perl. 

Since 2008, the Python community has been trying to catch 
up with specific languages for scientific computing, such 
as Matlab and R. Due to its versatility, Python is now used 
frequently for research in AI. However, although python has 
some of the advantages of functional programming, run-time 
speeds are still far behind other functional languages, such 
as Lisp or Haskell, and even more so from C/C++.  
In addition, it lacks of efficiency when managing large 
amounts of memory and highly-concurrent systems.

From 2010 and mostly driven by the necessity of translating 
AI into commercial products, (that could be used by 
thousands and millions of users in real time), IT corporations 
looked for alternatives by creating hybrid languages, that 
combined the best from all paradigms without compromising 
speed, capacity and concurrency. In recent years, new 
languages such as Scala and Go, as well as Erlang or 
Clojure, have been used for applications with very high 
concurrency and parallelization, mostly on the server side. 
Well-known examples are Facebook with Erlang or Google 
with Go. New languages for scientific computation have also 
emerged such as Julia and Lua. 

Although functional programming has been popular in 
academia, its use in industrial settings has been marginal 
and mainly during the times when “expert systems” were at 
their peak, predominantly during the 1980s. After the fall of 
expert systems, functional programing has, for many years, 
been considered a failing relic from that period. However, as 
multiprocessors and parallel computing are becoming more 
available, functional programming is proving to be a choice 
of many programmers to maximise functionality from their 
multicore processors. These highly expensive computations 
are usually needed for heavy mathematical operations or 
pattern matching, which constitute a fundamental part 
of running an AI system. In the future, we will see new 
languages that bring simplifications on existing functional 
languages such as Haskell and Erlang and make this 
programming paradigm more accessible. In addition, the 
advent of the internet-of-things (IoT) has drawn the attention 
to the programming of embedded systems. Thus, efficiency, 
safety and performance are again matters for discussion. 
New languages that can replace C/C++ incorporating 
tips from functional programming (e.g. Elixir) will become 
increasingly popular. Also, new languages that incorporate 
simplifications as well as a set of functions from modern 
imperative programming, while maintaining a performance 
like C/C++ (e.g. Rust), will be another future development.



Programming languages played a major role in the evolution of AI. 
Driven by the necessity of translating AI into commercial products, 
hybrid languages are emerging, which combine the best from all 
paradigms without compromising speed, capacity and concurrency.

11.  IMPACT OF MACHINE VISION

Machine vision integrates image capture systems with 
computer vision algorithms to provide automatic inspection 
and robot guidance. Although it is inspired by the human 
vision system, based on the extraction of conceptual 
information from two-dimensional images, machine vision 
systems are not restricted to 2D visible light. Optical sensors 
include single beam lasers to 3D high definition Light 
Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) systems, also known as 
laser scanning 2D or 3D sonar sensors and one or multiple 
2D camera systems. Nevertheless, most machine vision 
applications are based on 2D image-based capture systems 
and computer vision algorithms that mimic aspects of 
human visual perception. Humans perceive the surrounding 
world in 3D and their ability to navigate and accomplish 
certain tasks depends on reconstructing 3D information from 
2D images that allows them to locate themselves in relation 
to the surrounding objects. Subsequently, this information  
is combined with prior knowledge in order to detect and 
identify objects around them and understand how  
they interact. Scene reconstruction along with object 
detection and recognition are the main sub-domains of 
computer vision. 

Regardless of the imaging sensors used, the most common 
approaches of reconstructing 3D information are normally 
based on either time-of-flight techniques, multi-view 
geometry and/or on photometric stereo. The former is used 
in laser scanners to estimate the distance between the 
light source and the object based on the time required for 
the light to reach the object and return back. Time-of-flight 
approaches are used to measure distances in kilometres and 

they are accurate to a millimetre scale, since they are limited 
by the ability to measure time. On the other hand, multi-view 
geometry problems include ‘structure’ problems, ‘stereo 
correspondence’ problems and ‘motion’ problems. Recovery 
of the 3D ‘structure’ implies that given 2D projections of the 
same 3D point, in two or more images, the 3D coordinates 
of the point are estimated based on triangulation. ‘Stereo 
correspondence’ refers to the problem of finding the image 
point that corresponds to a point from another 2D view. 
Finally, ‘motion’ refers to the problem of recovering the 
camera coordinates given a set of corresponding points 
in two or more image views. 3D laser scanners based 
on triangulation can reach micrometre accuracy but their 
range is constrained to a few meters. Several sub-problems 
such as ‘structure from motion’ uses multi-view geometry 
principles to extract corresponding points between 2D views 
of the same object and reconstruct its shape.

Stereo-vision assumes the robust extraction of corresponding 
salient points/features across images, the so-called interest 
point detection. These features should be invariant to 
photometric transformation such as changes in the lighting 
conditions and covariant to geometric transformations. 
For over two decades researchers have proposed several 
approaches. The Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) 
extracts features that are invariant to scale, rotation and 
translation transformations and robust to illumination 
variations and moderate perspective transformations.  
Since its introduction in 1999-2004, it has been successful  
in several vision applications, including object recognition, 
robot localisation and mapping. 



33 // Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

Representing and recognising object categories have proven 
much harder problems to generalise and solve, compared 
with 3D reconstruction, since there are thousands of 
objects that can belong to an arbitrary number of categories 
simultaneously. Several ideas about object detection are 
related to Gestalt psychology, which is a theory of mind 
with relation to visual perception. A major aspect of the 
theory is about grouping entities together based on their 
proximity, similarity, symmetry, common fate, continuity and 
so on. From the 1960s to early 1990s, research in object 
recognition was centred on geometric shapes. This was a 
bottom-up process, which uses a small number of primitive 
3D dimensional objects that are assembled together in 
various configurations to form complex objects. In the 1990s, 
appearance-based models were explored, which were based 
on manifold learning of the object appearance parameterised 
by the pose and illumination [66]. These techniques are not 
robust to occlusion, clutter and deformation. By the mid-
late 1990s, sliding window approaches were designed that 
classify whether an object is found for each instance of a 
sliding window across an image [67]. The main challenges 
were how to design features that represent appropriately the 
appearance of the object and how to efficiently search a large 
number of positions and scales. Local features approaches 
were also developed and they aimed towards those which 
were invariant to image scaling, geometric transformations 
and illumination changes [68]. In the early 2000s 'parts-and-
shape' models along with 'bags of features' were suggested. 
Parts-and-shape models represent complex objects using 

combinations of multi-scaled deformable objects [69].  
On the other hand, bags of features methods, represent 
visual features as words and relate object recognition and 
image classification to the expressive power of natural 
language processing approaches [70].

Machine learning in object recognition facilitated a shift, from 
solving a problem based on mathematical modelling alone, 
to learning algorithms based on real-data and statistical 
modelling. A major breakthrough in object recognition and 
classification came in 2012 with the emergence of deep 
neural networks and the availability of large labelled image 
databases, such as ImageNet. Compared to classical object 
recognition methods, which depend on feature extraction 
followed by feature matching methodologies, deep learning 
has the advantage of encoding both feature extraction and 
image classification via the structure of a neural network.  
The superb performance of deep neural networks resulted 
in an increase of image classification from 72% in 2010 to 
96% in 2015, which outperforms human accuracy and has 
had a significant impact in real-life applications [71]. Both 
Google and Baidu updated their image search capabilities 
based on the Hinton’s deep neural network architecture. Face 
detection has been introduced in several mobile devices and 
Apple even created an app to recognise pets. The accuracy 
of these models in object recognition and image classification 
exceed human-level accuracy and spread waves of 
technological changes across the industry.

Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  // 36

The development of AI is closely coupled with our pursuit 
of understanding the human brain. A long-term goal of 
computational neuroscience is to emulate the brain by 
mimicking the causal dynamics of its internal functions so 
that the models relate to the brain functions in human/animal 
behaviour characteristics [72]. Although there is a lot of 
excitement that this approach would help understand how 
intelligent behaviour emerges, there is also heated debate on 
whether this is a realistic goal as we do not fully understand 
how the brain works [73, 74]. The human brain is highly 
complex with more than 80 billion neurons and trillion of 
connections. Simulation scales can range from molecular 
and genetic expressions to compartment models of 
subcellular volumes and individual neurons to local networks 
and system models. 

Deep Neural Network nodes are an oversimplification 
of how brain synapses work. Signal transmission in the 
brain is dominated by chemical synapses, which release 
chemical substances and neurotransmitters to convert 
electrical signals via voltage-gated ion channels at the 
presynaptic cleft into post-synaptic activity. The type of 
neurotransmitter characterises whether a synapse facilitates 
signal transmission (excitatory role) or prevents it (inhibitory 
role). Currently, there are tenths of known neurotransmitters, 
whereas new ones continuously emerge with varying 
functional roles. Furthermore, dynamic synaptic adaptations, 
which affect the strength of a synapse, occur in response 
to the frequency and magnitude of the presynaptic signal 
and reflect complex learning/memory functions, (Spike 
time dependent plasticity). Recently, evidence has found 
that surrounding cells, such as glia cells that are primarily 
involved in ‘feeding’ the neurons, can also affect their 
function via the release of neurotransmitters. 

The earliest and most elaborate attempts for modelling 
neuronal complexity are based on conductance-based 
biophysical models of synaptic interaction (COBA) and 
spike generation, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. 
Several popular software platforms, such as GENESIS and 
NEURON, exploit COBA models to develop systematic 
modelling approaches of realistic brain networks. Simpler 
models, such as integrate-and-fire, are faster to simulate 
and they are also used in large-scale simulations when the 
dynamics of spike generation are less important. 

It is evident that the computational complexity of the brain 
networks depends not only on the number of neurons and 
synapses but also on the topology of the network and 

the level of biological details it describes. The mammalian 
cerebral cortex is organised intuitively to minimise wiring. 
Group of neurons form cortical columns, which encode 
functionally similar features and they are considered the 
smallest functional brain units from where consciousness 
emerges. In fact the major objective of the Blue Brain 
project, a leading research project on computational 
neuroscience, started in 2005, was to emulate the rat 
neocortical columns of around 10,000 neurons and  
108 synapses. 

Currently, there is a trend toward developing neuromorphic 
hardware circuits to allow near real-time large-scale 
simulations of neural networks [75]. The neuromorphic term 
refers to mimicking the structure of neurons (dendrites, 
axon and synapse) to achieve functional equivalence. For 
example, the Neurogrid is a neuromorphic supercomputer, 
developed at Stanford, which combines analogue dendritic 
computation (presynaptic ion-channel function) with digital 
axonal communication. Each chip integrates one million 
neurons interconnected with 256 million synapses. Analog 
implementations are more directly related to synaptic activity 
and thus maximise energy efficiency and allow emulation 
of a greater number of neurons and synapses. On the 
other hand, digital implementations are more flexible to 
reconfigure and allow storage of connectional weights with 
greater precision. One of the most promising technologies 
in this area is the memristors, which has the ability to 
simultaneously perform logical and storage operations. 
Similar to neural synapses, the more current that flows 
through a memristor, the more it can flow. Therefore, it can 
model several biological functions including COBA synaptic 
interactions time varying delayed networks and spike-
timing-dependent plasticity. Memristors have the potential to 
replace the existing digital/analog neuromorphic chips with 
much more efficient and versatile technology. 

With the current exponential growth in the efficiency and 
flexibility of neuromorphic hardware, the ability to make a 
computer as fast and as complex as the human brain is 
becoming increasingly possible. Several large simulations  
of the brain are aimed to mainly replicate the cortical 
dynamics obtained in in-vivo and in-vitro key neuroscience 
studies and validate cognitive theories and hypothesis.  
The big question is if this would result in a conscious, 
intelligent creature and how we would be able to detect this 
in the very beginning without a thorough understanding of 
what consciousness or intelligence is.

13. ETHICAL AND LEGAL QUESTIONS OF AI

Threat to Privacy 
Data is the “fuel” of AI and special attention needs to be 
paid to the information source and if privacy is breached. 
Protective and preventive technologies need to be 
developed against such threats. Although solutions to this 
issue may be unconnected to the AI operation per se, it 
is the responsibility of AI operators to make sure that data 
privacy is protected. Additionally, applications of AI, which 
may compromise the rights to privacy, should be treated 
with special legislation that protects the individual.

Threats to security and weaponisation of AI

With the proliferation of security risks, such as terrorism 
and regional conflicts, we are immersed in a global arms 
race that has developed a demand for new weapons 
powered by AI, such as autonomous drones and missiles, 
as well as virtual bots and malicious software aimed at 
sophisticated espionage. This could lead to the possibility 
of an unprecedented war escalation. The danger of AI is 
that we could potentially lose control over it. This has led 
associations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)  
to carry out awareness-raising actions to contain the use  
of these military robots and potentially ban the use of  
such weapons. 

The US military has just released a prospective document 
entitled ‘Robotic and Autonomous Systems Strategy’, which 
details its strategy for robotics and autonomous systems. 
The use of robotics and autonomous systems by the US 
military defines the following five objectives: 1) Increase 
knowledge abilities in operations’ theatres, 2) Reduce 
the amount of charge carried by the soldier; 3) Improve 
logistics capacity; 3) Facilitate movement and manoeuvring; 
4) Increase the protection of forces. Although offensive 
capacity is not mentioned, the four points introduced by  
the US military are ambiguous with respect to their scope 
and limitations.

Economics and Employment Issues 
Currently, 8% of jobs are occupied by robots, but in 2020 
this percentage will rise to 26%. Robots will become 
increasingly autonomous and be able to interact, execute 
and make more complex decisions. Thanks to 'big data', 
robots now have a formidable database that allows them to 
experiment and learn which algorithms work best.  
The accelerated process of technological development  
now allows labor to be replaced by capital (machinery). 
However, there is a negative correlation between the 
probability of automation of a profession and its average 
annual salary, suggesting a possible increase in short-term 
inequality [76]. The problem is not the number of jobs lost 
through automation, but in creating enough to compensate 
for potential job losses. In previous industrial revolutions, 
new industries hired more people than those who lost their 
jobs in companies that closed, because they could not 
compete with the speed of development in new technologies 
[77]. An important note, about this revolution, is the fact that 
it is not only the manual trades likely to be automated, but 
also in jobs involving tasks of an intermediate nature, such 
secretarial, administration and other office work. To deal with 
this situation, it is necessary to put in place legal frameworks 
that make sure the benefits of automation do not solely go 
to the employer but are distributed equally, to guarantee the 
maintenance of education, health and pensions. 

Human Bias in Artificial Intelligence 
In an article published by Science magazine, researchers 
saw how machine learning technology reproduces human 
bias, for better or for worse. Words related to the lexical 
domain of flowers are associated with terms related to 
happiness and pleasure (freedom, love, peace, joy, paradise, 
etc.). The words relating to insects are, conversely, close to 
negative terms (death, hatred, ugly, illness, pain, etc.).  

13.1 ETHICAL ISSUES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE



Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  // 40

This reflects the links that humans have made themselves.  
AI biases have already been highlighted in other applications. 
One of the most notable was probably Tay, a Microsoft 
AI launched in 2016, which was supposed to embody a 
teenager on Twitter, able to chat with internet users and 
improve through conversations. However, in just a few hours, 
the program, learning from its exchanges with humans, 
began to make racist and anti-Semitic remarks, before  
being suspended by Microsoft (see Sidebar – Failures of 
AI). The problem is not only at language level. When an AI 
program became a juror in a beauty contest in September 
2016, it eliminated most black candidates as the data on 
which it had been trained to identify “beauty” did not contain 
enough black skinned people. 

13.2 LEGAL ISSUES AND QUESTIONS OF AI
 
Legal Responsibility 
Initially, the legal framework that would apply to robots 
and AI would have the purpose of limiting the risks derived 
from the operation of these systems and limit the damage 
that could occur from unintended consequences with their 
operation. AI could not have constitutional rights, as these 
are the property of individuals, but can have some property 
rights, in order to guarantee their possible liability for any 
damage caused. For this reason they could have some form 
of judicial protection. In this case, robots and AI would be 
subject to two types of responsibility: 1) Predictability in their 
actions; and 2) civil liability in any harmful consequences of 
their actions (although there is also a fiscal responsibility as  
a consequence of non-compliance with the obligations of 
this type). 

The European Parliament is already working on a 
Recommendations Report (2015/2103, dated 31 May 
2016) on civil law on robotics, which provides guidelines for 
regulating civil liability arising from the use of robots [78]. It 
refers to the contractual and non-contractual responsibilities 
that may derive from its action and recommends that this 
liability be defined as an objective as well as establishing 
the need to have compulsory insurance for civil liability, for 
any damages arising from the possession and use of such 
robots. That means that in the event of an accident, the 
report proposes a compulsory insurance scheme, a policy 
identical to that of automobiles. The manufacturers will have 
a contractual obligation to compensate possible victims and 
to consolidate a fund to protect against robot accidents. The 

report also considers the effect of “short-circuits”,  
to protect humans from any accidents or aggression.  
This does not mean that the responsibility of man will be 
entirely negated but rather a sliding scale could be created: 
the more sophisticated a robot is, the more responsibility  
the designer would bear. 

In view of the recent government policy, autonomous 
machines (cars without drivers, drones, medical devices)  
will soon have civil liability. Autonomous machines must have 
a name, a first name and a registration number. In the event 
of an accident, identification will be aided with some kind of  
civil status. 

Civil Rights for AI and Robots 
Robots, to the extent that they are autonomous, could 
be granted the status of electronic persons with specific 
rights and obligations. There are also calls to harmonize the 
cohabitation between robots and humans. For instance, 
domestic robots are sort of “intimate gadgets”. They create 
the notion of empathy with the humans they interact with 
on a daily basis. A legal framework would make it possible 
to crystallize this particular type of relationship in law. In 
comparison with domestic animals, whose legal status 
was clarified in January 2015, can be drawn here. There is 
however a distinction in that, unlike animals, robots are not 
biologically alive and have no sensitivity. However, they are 
still endowed with an intelligence that can be superior to one 
of an animal. The idea of providing AI systems and robots 
a set of rights, such as ones provided to domestic animals, 
requires an understanding of how machines could process 
their own feelings and emotions, if machines are equipped in 
future with some sort of emotional intelligence.

From the point of view of the labour market, the use of 
robots will mean the disappearance of certain jobs that,  
until now, have been performed by humans. To reduce  
the social impact of unemployment caused by robots  
and autonomous systems, the EU parliament proposed 
that they should pay social security contributions and taxes 
as if they were human. By producing a surplus value from 
their work, they generate an economic benefit. It is one of 
the more controversial points in the proposals of the EU 
Robotics Report.



41 // Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

AI has the potential to change the world but there are 
still many problems to overcome before its widespread 
applications. Furthermore, its practical use is not without 
failures (see Fig 13, Example Failures of AI). Recently, 
we have seen a surge of interest in deep learning with 
promising results that will reshape the future of AI. But deep 
learning is only one of the many tools that the AI community 
has developed over the years. It is important to put into 
perspective the current development of AI and its specific 
limitations.

Intelligence as a multi-component model: A machine to be 
called “intelligent” should satisfy several criteria that include 
the ability of reasoning, building models, understanding 
the real word and anticipate what might happen next. The 
concept of “intelligence” is made of the following high-level 
components: perception, common sense, planning, analogy, 
language and reasoning. 

Large datasets and hard generalisation: After extensive 
training on big datasets, today machines can achieve 
impressive results in recognising images or translating 
speech. These abilities are obtained thanks to the derivation 
of statistical approximations on the available data. However, 
when the system has to deal with new situations when 
limited training data is available, the model often fails. We 
know that humans can perform recognition even with small 
data since we can abstract principles and rules to generalise 
to a diverse range of situations. The current AI systems are 
still missing this level of abstraction and generalisability. 

Black box and a lack of interpretation: Another issue 
with the current AI system is the lack of interpretation. For 
example, deep neural networks have millions of parameters 
and to understand why the network provides good or bad 
results becomes impossible. Despite some recent work on 
visualising high-level features by using the weight filters in a 
convolution neural network, the obtained trained models are 
often not interpretable. Consequently, most researchers use 
current AI approaches as a black box.

Robustness of AI: Most current AI systems can be easily 
fooled, which is a problem that affects almost all machine 
learning techniques. 

Despite these issues, it is certain that AI will play a major role 
in our future life. As the availability of information around us 
grows, humans will rely more and more on AI systems to 
live, to work and to entertain. Therefore, it is not surprising 
that large tech firms are investing heavily on AI related 
technologies. In many application areas, AI systems are 
needed to handle data with increasing complexities. Given 
increased accuracy and sophistication of AI systems, they 
will be used in more and more sectors including finance, 
pharmaceuticals, energy, manufacturing, education, 
transport and public services. In some of these areas they 
can replace costly human labour and create new potential 
applications and work along with/for humans to achieve 
better service standards. It has been predicted that the next 
stage of AI is the era of augmented intelligence. Ubiquitous 
sensing systems and wearable technologies are driving 
towards intelligent embedded systems that will form a 
natural extension of human beings and our physical abilities. 
Human sensing, information retrieval and physical abilities 
are limited in a way that AI systems are not. AI algorithms 
along with advanced sensing systems could monitor 
the world around us and understand our intention, thus 
facilitating seamless interaction with each other. 

Advances in AI will also play a critical role in imitating the 
human brain function. Advances in sensing and computation 
hardware will allow to link brain function with human 
behaviour at a level that AI self-awareness and emotions 
could be simulated and observed in a more pragmatic 
way. Recently, quantum computing has also attracted a 
new wave of interest from both academic institutions and 
technological firms such as Google, IBM and Microsoft. 
Although the field is at its infancy and there are major 
barriers to overcome, the computational power it promises, 
potentially relevant to the field of AI, is well beyond our 
imagination. 

14. LIMITATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF AI 



Figure 13 
Example failures of AI

Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  // 42

2016: Artificial intelligence fails to beat real stupidity. 
Microsoft lunched Tay, an AI Twitter bot that just 
after 24 hours turned into a racist, Hitler-lover, 
incestual sex-promoting robot. Tay was developed 
to learn by interacting with people, but it failed to 
cater for the darker side of human. 

2016: Tesla driver dies while using autopilot mode. 
A driver died in the first fatal crash involving a 
self-driving car. The car’s vision system failed to 
distinguish a large truck and trailer crossing the 
highway at full speed.

2016: Robots failed in their duties and lost their 
jobs. Three restaurants in China fired their robot 
waiters. The robots broke down continuously,  
two of the restaurants have closed and the third 
re-hired humans. 

2016: Service robot caused traffic jams. Promobot, 
a humanoid robot, was designed for promoting 
products or conduct surveys. It has created many 
traffic jams after escaping from its lab and it was 
also arrested while it was collecting voter opinions 
for political candidates to gain unfair advantage. 

1983: Nuclear attack early warning system falsely 
claimed that an attack is taking place. A nuclear 
warning system of the Soviet Union reported the 
launch of a ballistic missile from the United States. 
This was a false alarm that it could have cause a 
nuclear attack and an immediate escalation of the 
cold-war to a full-scale nuclear war. 

1966 Mistranslations DARPA funded a project  
to translate Soviet documents into English.  
It was a clear failure and after spending $20 million, 
it was closed.

2016: Search engine AI highly ranks fake news.  
The highly ranked entry of the Google search 
engine on the query ”Did the Holocaust happen” 
was a neo-Nazi and denial website. Since that, 
Google has tried to improve their AI search engine 
to provide authoritative results.

2016: Fatty the robot smashes glass and injures 
visitor. During a demonstration in China, a robot 
called Fatty piercing a bystander’s ankle after broke 
the glass of a booth. There hasn’t been much 
information about Fatty since the incident. 

2016: Facial recognition rejected a legitimate 
citizens. An AI face recognition software used in the 
administration office of New Zealand, rejected an 
Asian citizen since it mistakenly registered his eyes 
as being closed. Currently, it is estimated that 20% 
of faces are still mistakenly classified. 

2015: Adult content filtering software failed to 
remove inappropriate content. Google’s new 
YouTube Kids app failed to remove “inappropriate 
content,” including explicit sexual language and 
jokes about paedophilia.

1980: The Fifth Generation Computer Systems.  
A government/industry research project in 
Japan aimed to create a computer using parallel 
computing. After 10 years of research and $400 
million, the project was terminated without having 
met its goals to provide a platform for future 
developments in AI.



43 // Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

There are many lessons that can be learnt from the past 
successes and failures of AI. To sustain the progress of 
AI, a rational and harmonic interaction is required between 
application specific projects and visionary research ideas. 
Along with the unprecedented enthusiasm of AI, there are 
also fears about the impact of the technology on our society. 
A clear strategy is required to consider the associated ethical 
and legal challenges to ensure that the society as a whole 
will benefit from the evolution of AI and its potential adverse 
effects are mitigated from early on. Such fears should not 
hinder the progress of AI but motivate the development of a 
systematic framework on which future AI will flourish. Most 
critical of all, it is important to understand science fiction 
from practical reality. With sustained funding and responsible 
investment, AI is set to transform the future of our society - 
our life, our living environment and our economy. 

The following recommendations are relevant to the UK 
research community, industry, government agencies and 
policy makers: 

•  Robotics and AI are playing an increasingly important 
role in the UK’s economy and its future growth. We need 
to be open and fully prepared for the changes that they 
bring to our society and their impact on the workforce 
structure and a shift in the skills base. Stronger national 
level engagement is essential to ensure the general public 
has a clear and factual view of the current and future 
development of robotics and AI.

•  A strong research and development base for robotics and 
AI is fundamental to the UK, particularly in areas in which 
we already have a critical mass and international lead. 
Sustained investment in robotics and AI would ensure the 
future growth of the UK research base and funding needs 
to support key Clusters/Centres of Excellence that are 
internationally leading and weighted towards projects with 
greater social-economic benefit.

•  It is important to address legal, regulatory and ethical 
issues for practical deployment and responsible 
innovation of robotics and AI; greater effort needs to 
be invested on assessing the economic impact and 
understanding how to maximise the benefits of these 
technologies while mitigating adverse effects.

•  The government needs to tangibly support the workforce 
by adjusting their skills and business in creating 
opportunities based on new technologies. Training in 
digital skills and re-educating the existing workforce is 
essential to maintain the competitiveness of the UK. 

•  The UK has a strong track record in many areas of RAS 
and AI. Sustained investment in robotics and AI is critical 
to ensure the future growth of the UK research base and 
its international lead. It is also critical to invest in and 
develop the younger generation to be robotics and AI 
savvy with a strong STEM foundation by making effective 
use of new technical skills.

The impact of robotics and AI will affect not only 
manufacturing, transport and healthcare, but also jobs 
in agrifood, logistics, security, retail, and construction. 
It is important to assess the economic impact and 
understand the social, legal and ethical issues of 
robotics and AI in order to maximise the benefits of 
these technologies while mitigating adverse effects. 
Establishing our lead in robotics and AI is an opportunity 
that the UK cannot afford to miss. The future lies in our 
coordinated effort to establish our niche and leverage the 
significant strengths we already have, and expand upon 
those areas that are strategic to the UK.
