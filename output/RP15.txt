learn new skills and implement new practices
 
that
 
leverage those new data sources and technologies

with corporations
 
in exchange
 
for

Unfortunately, 
with
 
big data
, as 
the data
 
grow

and expands 
in 

variety
 
(data types)
,
 
new problems emerge.  
Data volumes grow and 
data 
become
s
 
unmanageable 
and 
immovable. 
 
Scalability, security, and information latency become 
new 
issues.  
Dealing 
with 
unstructured data, sensor data 
and spatial data all introduce new 
data type 
complexities.

become
 
the next 
big 
challenge. The predictive model(s)

have 
to be 
somehow 
translated 
to SQL 
and 
recreated 
inside the database 
in 
order 
to 
apply the mod

and make
 
predictions on the 
larger
 
datasets maintained in

This 
model translation phase 
introduces tedious

steps 
from 
the original
 
statistical language 
(SAS, R,

somehow
 

productionize

these

for distribution
 
throughout the enterprise.  
Some vendors will charge for specialized products and 
options for just for predictive model de

This is where many 
advanced analytics 
projects fail
.  
Add Hadoop, sensor data, tweets, and expanding 
big

Oracle Database.   
 
Data analysts/scientists have choice and flexibility in how they interact with Oracle Advanced 
Analytics.  
Oracle Data Miner is an Oracle SQL Developer extension designed for data analysts that 
provides 

mining functions (Oracle Data Mining).  
Oracle SQL Developer is a free integrated development 
environment that simplifies the development and management of Oracle Databas
e in both traditional 
and Cloud deployments. 
When 
Oracle Data Miner users 
are satisfied with their analytical 
methodologies
, they can share their workflows 
with 
other analysts 
and/or generate SQL 
scripts to hand 
to their DBAs 
to accelerate 
model 
deployment
.  
Oracle Data Miner also provides a PL/SQL API for 
workflow scheduling and automation.  
 
R programmers and data scientists can use 
the 
familiar 
open source R statistical programming 
language console, 
RStudio 
or any 
IDE 
to work directly with data inside th
e database and leverage

New Opportunities and New Challenge
s
 
Gartner characterizes big data
 
as: 
"high volume, velocity, and/or variety information assets that demand new, 
innovative forms of processing for enhanced decision making, business insights or process optimization." 
 
However, 
for 
many
, this is not new.  C
ompanies have been data mining large volumes of data for 
years

new 
and more challenging is the 
increasing 
pace of 
the 

volumes, velocities and
 
varieties of 
sources 
coupled 
with
 
new customer 
expectations of what 


can
 
be achieved
.  This places new 
demands on 
Information Technology (IT) departments
, data scientist and data analysts
 
and the 
departments and lines
 
of 
business they support e.g. marketing, customer service, support, R&D and operations.  
 
Unfortunatel
y, as big data grows and expands 
over time 
in 
its
 

emerge.  Data volumes grow and 
eventually 
become 
near 
immovable.  Eventually at some point, it becomes 
impractical to move
 
large
 
data 
amounts 
to separat
e servers for 
the 
data analysis.  During 
the 
big
 
data explosion, 
many problems are experienced such as data movement, data duplication, 
security
,
 
cr

sprawl
-

, separation
 
of data management 
from
 
data analysis and worse
, 
informat
ion latency 
expands
, 
oftentimes to multiple 
days
 
and 
weeks
.
 
Traditional data analysis methods contribute to these problems
.  
Data analysts and data scientist typically have their

SPSS or 
Python,

)
 
so require data e
xtract
s
 
from the 
database 
/
data warehouse
, 
transform
s
 
and load
s
 
to 
dedicated, separate
 
analytical servers
.  If a data scientist 
builds 

a new problem emerges.  D
eployment 
of that model 
to where and when it 
is most 
needed and integration into applications 
e.g. BI dashboards, call centers, websites, ATMs and mobile devices 
becomes the next big challenge
 
for IT
. The predictive model(s)

and all 
the 
associated data preparation and 
transformation steps

have to be 
recreated 
in the destination platform 
to make 
the 
predictions on the larger data 
tables
.  For Oracle environments, this export, data analysis, import results outer loop complicates the data analysis 
unnecessarily and 
introduces the time consuming and expen
sive 
model deployment phase.  
IT is asked to 

productionize

the
 
models 
and re
-
implement them using SQL
 
in
side
 
the database.  
 
The challenge is that the models were originally created using 
a 
statistical programming language
 
(SAS, R, 
SPSS 
and Python
.)
 
but t
o productionize them, they must run as SQL
 
functions
 
inside the database
.  This is where the big 
time sink occurs
 
and

Predictive Analytics 
as a technology 
has been delivering 
measurable value for years.  Predictive An

.  Today in 2015, predictive analytics are being implemented and deployed in 
enterprises and 
appl
ications ranging
 
from predicting churn and employee turnover, to flagging medical fraud and tax non
-
compliance 
to targeted selling 
and
 
real

.  As big data analytics technolog
ies
 
and user adopti
ons 
evolve, 
mature and expand, 
predictive analytics 
use cases and integrated 

applications 


are emerging every day
 
and are constantly raising the bar of new user expectations
.
 
 
Oracle Advanced Analytics provides support for 
these data driven problem
s
 
by offering
 
a wide range of 
powerful 
workhorse data mining algorithms that have been implemented in a relational database environment (RDBMS)
.  
Algorithms are implemented 
as SQL functions 
inside the database

 
algorithms 
hence 
l
everage all related SQL features and 
can mine data in its original star schema representation 
including 
standard structured tables and views, transactional data and aggregations, unstructured i.e. CLOB data 

nd spatial data.
  
Oracle 
Advanced Analytics

mining functions take advantage of parallelism inside the database for both model build and model apply, honor all 
security and user privilege schemes, adhere to revision control and audit tr
acking database features and can mine 
data in its native and potentially encrypted form inside the Oracle Database.  
 
 
 
Oracle Advanced Analytics 12c data mining functions
 
are implemented as SQL functions that can be accessed by SQL, PL/SQL, R 
and the Ora
cle Data Miner GUI
.
 
Move the Algorithms

Data is big; algorithms are
 
small.  Hence, i

to
 
move the algorithms
 
to the data rather than 
moving the data to the algorithms

SQL
 
and R Support
 
Where SQL is the standard l
anguage for data management
 
and has been for 40+ years
, for data analysis
,
 
various 
languages compete

R, SAS, Python
 
and SQL and others.  SAS, S+, SQL, SPSS and Matlab have been long time 
favorites, but in recent past years, open source R especially has sur
ged to the top of the pack and Python and 
others have emerged.  P
er 
the 
KDD Nuggets 
data mining industry community annual 
polls 
(
http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/
), R and SQL currently compete 
for #1 and #2 posit
ions
,
 
respectively.  
 
The good news is that Oracle 
Advanced Analytics 
supports both
 
languages

SQL and R
.  
There are legions of 
developers who know SQ
L for data management and Oracle 
provides
 
support for data 
mining and advanced 
analytics 
via
 
Oracle Advance

SQL 
data mining functions 
and 
provides 
tight, industry leading 
integration 
with 
open source 
R
 
statistical programming language
. 
 
Most Oracle customers are very familiar with SQL as a language for query, reporting, and analysis of structured 
da
ta. It is the de facto standard for analysis and the technology that underlies most BI tools. R is a 
widely 
popular 
open source programming language for statistical analysis
 
that is free and because of that is taught in most data

Over the past 15 years, 
Oracle Advanced Analytics has 
evolved and now can 
autom
ate 
most 
of the steps 
typically required in data mining projects.  
Today, Automated Data Preparation (ADP) automatically bins numeric 
attributes using default and user customizable binning strategies e.g. equal width, equal count, user
-
defined and 
similarl

-
defined bins.  Missing values are 
automatically replaced by a statistical value (i.e. mean, median, mode, etc.) instead of that record being removed 
from the analysis.  
ADP is used both fo
r model building and then again for applying the models to new data.  Users 
can of course override ADP settings if they choose.
 
Oracle Advanced Analytics provides support for attribute reduction (Attribute Importance using the Minimum 
Description Length al
gorithm) and feature reduction techniques (Principal Components Analysis and Non
-
Negative 
Matrix Factorization).  However, 
each
 
of the Oracle Advanced Analytics algorithm
s (e.g. Decision Trees, 
Generalized Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes, K
-
Means Clustering, Expectation 
Maximization Clustering, Anomaly Detection 1
-
Class SVMs, etc.) has their own built
-
in automated strategies for 
attribute reduction 
and selection
 
so the an explicit varia
ble reduction step is optional
, but not necessary.  
Users of 
course can control 
algorithm and data preparation
 
settings or accept the 
intelligent 
defaults.
 
Transactional data, e.g. purchases, transactions, events, et
c. represent m
uch of the data that is important 
to build 
good predictive models.  
Oracle Advanced Analytics 
mines this data in its native transactional form and 
leverages 

it and then 
feed
 
vector of the data
 
(e.g. item purchases)
 
and join 
it 
to 
other customer 2
-
D data 
to provide a 360 degree customer view.  Oracle Advanced Analytics models, e.g. 
classification, regression and clustering models, 
ingest this
 
aggregated transactional 
attribute
 
as 
a 


.  

in
-
database 
processing, records are processed as triplets: Unique_ID, 
Attribute_name, 
and Attribute

just 
part of 
the secret sauce of 
how Oracle Advanced Analytics 
leverages the 
core strengths of
 
the Oracle D
atabase.
  
Market basket analysis would of course mine this data in its 
native transactional data form (typically not aggregated) to find co
-
occurring items in baskets.
 
Unstructured data i.e. text 
is also processed in a similar fashion inside t
he database.

Oracle Data Miner, a SQL Developer extension, provides a drag and drop workflow user interface for data analysts to explore t
heir 
data, build, evaluate and apply predictive models and deploy advanced analytical method
ologies as SQL and PL/SQL scripts.
 
 
Data analysts can use 
Oracle Data Miner 
to 
experiment and 
assemble 
very 
simple to complex
 
advanced analytical 
methodologies.  For example, a data analyst may want to combine transactional data, demographic data, customer
 
service data and customer comments to assemble a 360 degree customer view.  
T
hey
 
may decide to perform 
clustering on the customers to 
pre

assign them to customer segments and then
,
 
for each segment
 
build separate 
different 
classification, regression or an
omaly detection models
 
for better accuracy and usefulness
.    
 
 
Data analysts can quickly build simple to sophisticated analytical methodologies that mine data they have access to in the Or
acle

Oracle R Enterprise integrates R with Oracle Database
 
and maps R functions to equivalent SQL and Oracle Data 
Mining SQL functions and is d
esigned for problems 
involving large amounts of data
. 
It is a set of R packages 
(ORE) 
and Oracle Database 
features that enable an R user to operate on database
-
resident data without using SQL and to 
execute R scripts in one or more embedded R engines that run on the database server.
  
Data analysts and data 
scientists can develop, refine, and deploy R scripts t
hat leverage the parallelism and scalability of the database 
and 
the SQL data mining functions to automate data analysis 
in one step

without having to learn SQL
 
Oracle R Enterprise has overloaded open source R methods and functions that transparently conve
rt standard R 
syntax into SQL. These methods and functions are in 
ORE 
packages that implement the Oracle R Enterprise 
transparency layer. With these functions and methods, 
R programmers
 
can create R objects that access, analyze,

and 
selected 
popular R packages. Because it 
runs as an embedded component of Oracle Database, Oracle R Enterprise can run any R package either by

Hadoop, Oracle Big Data Appliance and Big Data SQL
 
Big data is no
w often stored in Hadoop servers.  The separate data environment outside the database introduces 
new data management and data analysis challenges.  
Big Data SQL 
addresses this challenge by extending
 
SQL 
processing to Hadoop 
via
 
the Oracle Big Data Applianc
e.  

Big Data SQL pushes down SQL logic to operate 
on
 
Hive tables.  
Data analysts can
 
now more easily
 
take 
advantage of 
new 
big data sources 
of 
data of possibly 
unknown value
 
stored in big data reservoirs
 
and combine that 
data with 
data of known value
 
managed inside 
a
 
database and/or data warehouse.  
 
However, the data stored in Hadoop
 
may be voluminous and 
sparse representation (transactional
 
format
) and 
lacking in information density.
 
 
Given that much of the da
ta may come from sensors, Internet of Things, 

tweets

 
and 
other high volume sources, us
ers can leverage 
Big Data SQL to collect counts, maximum values, minimum values, 
thresholds 
counts above or below
 
user defined values
, averages, short
er
 
term averages a
nd counts 
and
 
longer time 
averages and counts, sliding SQL w
indow averages and counts
 
and comparisons of each to the other
.  
So, f
ilter
 


 
join
 
it
 
to other database data 
using Oracle Big Data SQL 
and
 
then 
mine *everything* 
inside the 
Or
acle Database using Oracle Advanced Analytics Option.
